MSG|1336| my driver actually cancelled my ride and now im being compensated for a ride that i didnt take
MSG|1337| driver passed us by
MSG|1338| someone was using my account !!! why uber crew dont ask for people info??  ridiculous !!!
MSG|1339| if i request an uber i do not expect it to take 15 minutes to come thats ridiculous you should just send a message stating that you guys dont have any cars available
MSG|1340| couldnt find driver, unable to contact driver. trip showed as in progress but i still waited for driver before giving up and cancelling.
MSG|1341|04 pm. the app said the uber would arrive in 2 minutes. i went outside immediately, where i waited for 15 minutes before needing to cancel my trip. my uber never showed up. i will now be late to work. the uber said that she was confused about where she was going. i ended up just calling a lyft because when i was trying to cancel my uber to order a new one, it was charging me a $5 fee\n\nkrystal lundin\n\nalso, is there an easier way to communicate with uber rather than having to lie about my issue so i can message someone?
MSG|1342| my driver cancelled on me and then i was assigned a driver over 15 minutes away so i had to cancel
MSG|1343| the money for the trip was taken out of my bank account even though i canceled this ride seconds after
MSG|1344| i was charged a cancelation fee even though i reordered a ride 4 mins later
MSG|1345| jean was a completely greedy jerk.  if he only wants people with luggage to order uber xl he should sign up for that.  my 70 year old parents and my 4 year old neice were needing a ride 20 blocks and he refused us service because "too much luggage should've ordered an xl.  they had 1 large piece and 1 medium and 3 back pack sized pieces which could have easily sat on the back seat while one of them rode in the front of a regular uber x sized car.  they were driven in a toyota corolla to the airport with the same amount of people and the same amount of bags. they all fit! it was extremely hott, we just got off a 2 hour bus ride to get here and be treated that way by an uber driver was shocking and quite frankly shameful!   this is the type of behavior that i received as a taxi rider and then a lyft rider, i've consistently chosen uber as my ride choice because of the level of service and class it delivers.  i drove for uber myself and and never have i ever spoke to.riders like that.  i've had many opportunities where college kids would try to squeeze 6 people in my 5 pass car.  i would kindly decline and offer solutions. once i even went back to pick the 5th and 6th people up and drove them the 25 blocks free of charge because it was safer for them and me, and because i'm not a greedy jerk like your driver was today.  as a very regular customer i am disappointed and shook. i feel completely undervalued and i think what happened needs to be addressed.  a genuine  apology is very much in store here.  waiting...
MSG|1346| driver did not answer phone to confirm pick up location
MSG|1347| my driver never showed up. he accepted the trip but never showed up. i called him. he said he was coming. he did not come. then i canceled.

MSG|1361| driver was unfriendly, rude, and drove recklessly. i asked the driver a detour route and he got an attitude with me very rudely. driver made threats like he wanted to fight and demanded to get out of his vehicle.
MSG|1362| my driver look and act like they was on drugs and smell like they was drinking talkin too much
MSG|1363| never replied to text message a d phone calls- he parked the car after accepting ride

MSG|1371| my trip was supposed to be $8and change now you're charging me $11 and change
MSG|1372| i was dropped off at my location, i canceled my trip because my uber driver forgot to press drop off button
MSG|1373| i want my money back it should not have to pay
MSG|1374| the driver starts to go to my destination with out picking me up from where i were!
MSG|1375| hi was charge $22 for a ride i didnt cancel but uber cancel can i get a refund please
MSG|1376| he drove up and into a parking lot across the street where he did multiple laps when the house where we were standing was right there. he then drove out of the lot, flew past and did another u-turn. this is a quaint neighborhood where the pick up address is not complicated. his bizarre driving was concerning.
MSG|1377| his arrival was 4 minutes after he arrived in the 4 minutes he sat there for 43 seconds cancelled my trip and pulled off left me and my son standing in the rain
MSG|1378| you have to be kidding me! do you understand how serious this is? the driver picked someone else up and started the trip without me! and you are charging me 8$ for cancelling? are you serious??
MSG|1379| i have never have this before where i cant get pick up at my location and have to walk to a far locator get pick up once i at that location it say i at wrong spot that is so hard to get a ride my first time see this i went a refund

MSG|1385| this driver dropped me off at 474 natoma accidentally. please refund me the difference from 899 howard to 474 natoma. thanks
MSG|1386| why i never recieved my money back to my bank account . also you guys charged the fee and not even one minute past.. i want all my fee back to my bank account because that the payment form that i used.. i had credit in my uber account why i see a pending charged on my bank account .. soo mad at your service
MSG|1387| you showed a 9 minute wait time which was not shown before o requested the trip. this is false advertising
MSG|1388| driver was not at said location. driver started trip. driver answered phone call and proceeded to chat with friend and would not answer my questions. i was forced to cancel. extremely rude!
MSG|1389| driver screwed up an uber pool pickup and pulled over and was arguing and confused with the person who called him and had no idea what was going on
MSG|1390| i was standing in front of this driver, he didnt put his flashing lights. did not put down his windows to ask me if it was me which it clearly was. i was trying to get him to put his window down. he didnt and he drove off, passed my pick up point. completely unprofessional.
MSG|1391| the driver wouldnt come back to get me when he went passed me. he wanted to pick me up in a busy intersection and i stayed in the parking lot
MSG|1392| the driver couldnt find me, while the 2nd driver finds me right away - please remove the fee asap
MSG|1393|57 and never ended the trip, i think he is still confused on how it works but the trip was not ended and i was still being charged as if i was in the car and im in my hotel. i had to then press cancel because im not sure he would have figured it out and i would have been charged more. id like to make sure im charged the amount i was originally told because i do not want extra charges due to driver error. also is there another way i can dispute rides when i need to giving my detail instead of choosing automated responses? i had to do it this way because there was no other option for me to tell you details of the trip. thank you.
MSG|1394| took too long to request, if i was charged i want 4.81 put back into my chase credit account. please the time for this took too long as i have to go to work and be on time.
MSG|1395| i tried to call my driver but he didnt pick up and when i went outside i couldnt find him
MSG|1396| i know that i didnt get charged for my cancellation fee. but when i checked my bank account today, it said my card was charged. i looked in my trips and the price wasnt there. can you tell me who account was used with my credit card information ending with 1510
MSG|1397| the driver never showed up, started the trip and when i called him he realized he picked up the wrong passenger
MSG|1398| my driver kicked me out mid ride and said i cancelled the ride however i did not cancel it. can you see what happened on your end?
MSG|1399| i waited over 20 minutes and the driver never showed up. this is horrible service. i text him, i called him and didnt get a response
MSG|1400| the charge was never split with second passenger. please split and correct this charge.
MSG|1401| uber driver started trip before picking me up. when i called he kept saying he couldnt hear me so i canceled the trip. i was never picked up by this uber driver
MSG|1402| the driver never came to the pick up location and ignored my calls and texts. it says i was charged 5.80 and i want to be refunded for that
MSG|1403| drivers were no shows
MSG|1404| i ordered an uber but the driver never picked me up. he never came anywhere near the pick up location which was supposed to be near beach 69th st and burchell ave. instead he claimed to pick me up and proceeded to drop off a passenger that was already in the car. i should not have been charged for a trip i neve r took.
MSG|1405| driver was extremely rude and did not even say the correct name for my pick up! i would like a full refund
MSG|1406| i was not in the car. pick up wrong person. my balance was over 20. then down ro 11.  i was charged. had to cancel to request another ride. as you can see i did.
MSG|1407| my driver cancelled on me i need a refund
MSG|1408| at first there was five of us. but two got out the car and there was three of us. and he said he wont take us because we had five when we came in.
MSG|1409| driver never picked me up.
MSG|1410| just making sure my refund will be back on my card for my cancellation
MSG|1411| he didnt drive at all, the timer went off i dont appreciate the lie. i dont want credit. i want money back due to this lie.
MSG|1412| we requested the trip and showed us she was 1 minute away then immediately it showed trip in progress with 15 mins to our destination as the driver was driving away from us. we called the driver but she did not pick up. had no choice but to cancel the uber and request another one.
MSG|1413|            .
MSG|1414| hi i cancelled my trip on 5/6/19...the drver was driving a different direction and was atleast 15 minutes away. i had to cancel because it was clearly not in my direction. kindly refund this cancellation fee.
MSG|1415| not sure why this was requested, i did not request an uber
MSG|1416| the driver past right by me and didn't pick me up and he posted on his side that he had already when it was a lie. there was no route as you can see and the driver never came back to pick me up. i had to cancel because he refused to cancel the trip
MSG|1417| why my bank have a pending transaction 2x  ,the amount was $14.49  .i didnt take this request i  canceled  2 requests  in less than 1 .minute.why uber  took a pending charged on my accnt.? now i cant  make another request .
MSG|1418| my driver was driving wreckless and when i said something about it he refused my trip.
MSG|1419| uber came to wrong location
MSG|1420| my trip was given to 3 people, i was then kicked out of the 1st vehicle when the other driver called her and went off on her, the 3rd driver then called and tried to pick me up but could not find my location,. i lost 20 minutes and was charged for 75% of the trip. i then had to call another uber and am being charged for that trip. needless to say, im extremely frustrated and angry about what happened.

MSG|1425| 
MSG|1426| yesterday uber app was done. my tripe was canceled 2 times and  was waiting for new uber about 35 minutes
MSG|1427| he never actually picked me up. trying to play the system
MSG|1428| my driver did not speak any english and ended up taking us to jersey city when all we needed to go was 1 mile away at the doubletree timessquare. i refuse to pay for this trip!
MSG|1429| i booked the car by mistake and cancelled it in less than a minute
MSG|1430| the driver did not move for 5 minutes. you called him twice and he did not pick up. i am traveling to the airport and risked missing my flight due to the driver unresponsiveness. i should not be charged this cancellation fee
MSG|1431| the driver was horrible. just cancelled on me and i had to redo again another time. why does this keep happening
MSG|1432| no

MSG|1436| my driver and i couldnt connect to each other
MSG|1437| it starts without me getting in
MSG|1438| driver never picked me up
MSG|1439| this has happened multiple times where i specifically put in my home address and then the driver has a different location based on where i am. i live in a high rise and this gets really messed up. ive had to cancel and recall over 3 times now and it makes me late to work. this is completely unacceptable and its the uber apps fault. please let me know how i can fix this so it doesnt happen again
MSG|1440| please advise! this drivers car broke down en route. he made me and the other passengers cancel and exit the vehicle at 530am. he then drove away before my new uber arrived. i had to pay for a second uber and now im being charged double on this uber. not ok. fix it please!
MSG|1441| my drivers car broke down before arriving at the destination. he told me i had to cancel and get out at 530am in the tenderloin district. i had to then call another uber. now im being charged double the original price and its the drivers car that was the issue. please advise.
MSG|1442| he never move toward me , he was on a area that i cant be pick up , called me and was rude the way he talks .!
MSG|1443| n/a
MSG|1444| he told me to cancel it because we couldnt find each other
MSG|1445| my drivers pick up time kept changing and he did not move twds the pick up point
MSG|1446| driver called me and said that i was in a location that he could not pick me up. i offered to walk to him at a new location, instead he drove away without pickup, very unprofessional in action, if i am charged i want to at least be able to rate driver as highly unprofessional and warn other riders. i want my rider status returned to 4.96.
MSG|1447| driver started trip but i am not in vehicle so cancelled
MSG|1448| it still shows i was charged.   also for the last two weeks everyday - my ubers are farther away.   even when theyre are some close i am getting drivers 12 minutes away.    what good is platinum??????
MSG|1449| i had network difficulties and called the driver several times to cancel. despite that, the driver showed up and he asked me to take the ride. i told him to give me 5 minutes, but it wasn't enough time to get ready.  i proceeded to call him once more to cancel the ride, but instead of him cancelling he started the ride. i finally had network and cancelled the ride.
MSG|1450| my  auto location didnt pick up the correct address  driver was far from pickup spot could not edit it in app , app location services provided incorrect address
MSG|1451| driver was moving passed my pickup spot
MSG|1452| i need ny refund
MSG|1453| driver was taking 11 minutes or longer to come to my location. original estimated time said 3 minutes before i called the ride.
MSG|1454| my driver never picked me up
MSG|1455| i was waiting  outside 1607 michigan  av.  driver never picked me up i called imany times
MSG|1456| my driver started the ride, without me . never acknowledged me . just started the ride and proceeded towards my destination. nobody has ever tried this  move
MSG|1457| my uber driver submitted my ride as if i was in his car. however, i wasnt in his car and he was stuck in traffic. therefore, i had to cancel. i would like a refund, because this wasnt my fault. thank you so much!
MSG|1458| 
MSG|1459| i was still charged the full 10.34 for a ride a canceled in time
MSG|1460| i request a schedule trip yesterday for today and it never showed up and also i tried scheduling one this morning and the same thing happened thry both was cancelled and i dont know why and it cause me to be late this morning is there a reason behind the cancelled trip this has never happened before and wondering why today this happens when i scheduled a ride for today
MSG|1461| hi there is a bug with the uber software. both times i entered the address 67-02 150th street flushing ny as my pickup location and every time i did, the uber app then pinned me more than a ten minute walk from that location. i tried several times and had to cancel two trips as a result, and i got fined $5 two times! then i entered a neighboring address and it worked just fine. please fix and please refund my two $5 cancellation fees... thank you!!
MSG|1462| i was charged 2 cancellation fees and i was never picked up by this driver. one fee for $3 and the other for $5. the driver could not speak english and i couldn't get another ride after that. i waited 40 minutes
MSG|1463| luggages couldnt fit in the car. had to cancel and change to a xl.
MSG|1464| the driver picked up the wrong people and when i tried to explain to him he had the wrong people in his car he clearly did not understand anything i was saying. i spent 15 minutes waiting outside in the cold trying to explain that he had the wrong people in his car and then had to cancel the trip because we needed to a. get out of the cold and b. get where we needed to go and get a new ride. i want a refund on the cancellation the driver clearly doesnt deserve the money for the cancellation when he clearly didnt follow proper protocol by confirming who was in his vehicle.
MSG|1465| my driver was driving away
MSG|1466| ramons phone could not connect with uber due to ubers issues. we never left my street. i told him i didnt feel safe doing an uber trip that wasnt being monitored by uber so i asked him to let me get out and request anew an uber ride. i should not be charged a cancellation fee for that problem, nor should ramone, the driver.  please let me know the outcome because being charged a cancellation fee will be a big problem for me, given that i also lost 20+ minutes in my busy day trying to solve the problem.
MSG|1467| it said if i rebook within 15 mins cancellation fee would be waived
MSG|1468| the driver drove up to me and when i asked if it was uber he pulled off and it was raining i have bags so i had to walk down the street to get to him with my bags at the heat and pulled off when i was right there and then i will head to navigate him because he refused to use the gps and the final straw was when i was telling him the way to get to my house he decided not to listen so i had to get out and walk home because i had to use the restroom. was just a horrible experience
MSG|1469| i wasn't in the car when it said on your way
MSG|1470| driver picked up wrong passenger
MSG|1471| while waiting i noticed someone else took the trip, or possibly the uber just left me. i noticed the trip started, and the driver we well past my pickup location and the trip had already commented without me, the person who ordered, in it.
MSG|1472| someone else took this trip and the driver charged me for this trip.
MSG|1473| i was charged $19 for a trip i didn't take. please refund me
MSG|1474| our driver never showed up!!! and when i called he didnt speak english and could not communicate where he was or how much longer.  i had to cancel and call someone else.  im waiting at night at the airport for over 20 minutes and still do lot have a ride
MSG|1475| the driver was driving in the opposite direction and was too far away
MSG|1476| driver called and said he didnt want to take me, outrageous that i got a fee for this
MSG|1477| i was charge 14 dollars never got the uber i cancel i would like refund
MSG|1478| hi! i was on the other side of the building and wasn't notified the location.
MSG|1479| i didnt take the whole trip i got out on the next block because my brother called and told me my mom was i. the hospital and he was coming to get me so i got out of the uber and yall still charged me for the ride
MSG|1480| the driver was so understanding that i made a mistake by calling the uber. how do add a tip for nellie on my cancelled ride? nellie was so nice and professional.
MSG|1481| 7941
MSG|1482| i cancelled my ride less than 2 mins and it still charged a  fee
MSG|1483| i waited seven minutes when he was only 3 minutes away, and kept driving further and further away.
MSG|1484| the driver arrived at the destination in front of our hotel. he did not drive to the side and stop by the curb so that i could put my luggage
MSG|1485| i cancelled that trip because the driver was far away so i cancelled it and it says on my bank of america account that you guys took out the money it was $19.16 i got charged so can i get the money back?
MSG|1486| no.
MSG|1487| i was charged for a ride i had canceled which shows $0.00 on my ride history however on my banking history it still shows as the payment was taken
MSG|1488| my uber driver had another stop and it was taking longer than expected, so i cancel it but still got charged two times for the same uber ride
MSG|1489| good morning, i still got charged $9.17 the original price of an uber and thats unacceptable. i would like a refund please, i canceled because it was taking a while to find me an uber so i canceled and it should have not changed me for the uber if i didnt even get a driver or anything.
MSG|1490| canceled by accident! please charge the regular amount.
MSG|1491| my driver was very professional. i canceled the ride midway due to intoxication. he want on to drop me off at my apartment, even though id messed up.
MSG|1492| the dog was barking at me
MSG|1493| i could not find the driver but he started the trip anyways, i never took a trip with the driver so i should not be charged
MSG|1494| driver started the trip before he actually picked me up. he went to the wrong place as well.....
MSG|1495| the drivers vehicle is not sufficient to support seating more than one passenger safely since it is a two door pick up truck.
MSG|1496| driver drove to drop off destination and not pick. i called driver twice. driver would not answer. i had to cancel trip. new trip charged me more. i would like original rate of $8.58.
MSG|1497| i never met my driver and then realized he had started the trip. i called him and he said he was coming back but he never came so i cancelled the trip. i don't think i should be charged for this since i was where i was supposed to be (in the rain) and the driver never showed up or even tried to get in touch
MSG|1498| driver didn't pick me up. he picked up someone else thank you
