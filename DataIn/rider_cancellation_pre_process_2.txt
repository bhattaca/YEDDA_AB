MSG|168| should not have been on business account
MSG|169| my husband got in the car and closed the door, driver yelled at him not to slam the door.
MSG|170| canceled bc driver was rude and did not feel safe
MSG|171| idk
MSG|172| i think my driver didnt add me as in the car but was still able to know my drop off location? when i got home, it was still telling me to walk towards him and apologizing for the trip taking so long. i pressed cancel to end the trip but i wan to make sure he gets paid for the trip.
MSG|173| i never took this ride at all pick up point for this ride is not even in the same state that i was in i never seen this driver or car why was i still charged?
MSG|174| it failed to allow me to update my trip. i made a mistake and put ny instead of dallas. still used same uber driver for correct location but app did not allow me to update my location. requesting a refund for the trip to ny as we didnt even leave my origination location before i changed it.
MSG|175| driver cancelled
MSG|176| hi the walking direction given by uber asked me to walk to was misleading. i crossed a parking lot and reached a fence with no road to turn on to. i was unable to reach my pick up location. subsequently, i had to call for a new uber ride.
MSG|177| i cancelled within 30 seconds of booking was confirmed.
MSG|178| driver started trip before picking me up !!! i never entered car please refund before i delete uber !
MSG|179| my driver refused to pick me up and asked me to cancel
MSG|180| my driver made an illegal u-turn right after picking me up and got pulled over. look at the location of where the ride ended. i was in the car for 1 minute and had to call another uber. please refund me in the entire amount.
MSG|181| driver drove passed me and he started the trip, i was never picked up and i tried calling him, and he didnt know where my pickup location was, i had to cancel on him and i called another uber ride, please provide refund please!
MSG|182| my driver pressed that he picked me up before he got to my pick up location. then the car didnt move towards me so i has to cancel and got a new one
MSG|183| driver was headed away from us extending wait time by many minutes. canceled to get closer uber
MSG|184| i got in the car and hit cancel by mistake. she made me get out of her car and get another uber. i dont want to pay any fee. she didnt drive anywhere but was parked the entire time.
MSG|185| driver was moving in the wrong direction and did not answer two phone calls
MSG|186| driver didnt show in pickup area and out of no where he started the trip , when i called him he declined and i texted him that where he is through the app but he texted me back on my phone number that he cannot talk right now
MSG|187| today when i tried booking your express pool service, i was assigned a pick up spot outside the pickup area shown while booking. i had to wait for 8-10 min instead of 5 min wait to find that i had to walk way further. this was a waste of my time. now when i asked for my refund you refund me in uber credit. please revert the refund back to my credit card.
MSG|188| i would like to be refunded for this as the driver called and was having car trouble and said he was going to take longer than the time stated on the app. please refund me the cancel fee
MSG|189| i had to cancel this trip because the driver marked me as having been picked up but i never even saw his car. then i saw on the gps that he was driving away but i could not order a new car without cancelling
MSG|190| he too longer then usual and he tried to pick me up after i cancelled your app wasn't allowed me to cancel n o been pushed cancel
MSG|191| i had to cancel several times because all of the drivers that i was offered were 15-16 minutes away. i kept reselecting, assuming that i would get a closer driver, but this last one that i cancelled was 16  minutes away from me. it was late at night and i had just arrive from the airport and i could not wait outside alone for 16 minutes to be picked up. i do not think it is fair that i was charged a $5 cancellation fee. 16 minutes is an unreasonable wait time, especially late at night for a young woman alone.
MSG|192| the driver picked up someone else instead of me for my route. she never came to my location
MSG|193| yeah i want a refund the uber drive said he picked me up and charged me and kept driving and i wasnt in the uber so now i had to canceled my ride nd im goin to be hour late to work and have to pay higher fees for my ride when i ordered on time
MSG|194| this ride was false ride. the app said that the driver had already pocked me up and in fact that was not true so i had to cancel in order to be able to take another uber.
MSG|195| my driver never arrived at the location to pick me up. even after sending a message and calling him.
MSG|196| the driver never arrived without picking me up driver changed the status to trip in progress
MSG|197| paypal account
MSG|198| this trip was inadvertently booked to a location in california from denver airport.  we remained in the same car and were able to obtain the same driver for the correct address.  youll see the trip with the same driver immediately thereafter.  can you please credit my account for the duplicate charge for the same ride given the error?.
MSG|199| i would like my cancellation fee money back i cancel this drive or seven times because i am a female i do not feel comfortable with driving with two males inside the car and if i cancel this driver more than five times perhaps you guys should not keep on sending me the same driver allowing the driver to except the ride
MSG|200| the driver cancelled for unknown reason. trip rebooked immediately with another driver.
MSG|201| i want to report this serious matter, when i met the driver i was opening the door but when the driver saw me he took off immediately. i dont why what was the reason behind this act i dont know if it was racist or what was the deal but i want to report this such act , he drove off while i was opening the door i almost fell
MSG|202| as i walked to this drive a car twice he pulled away finally he stopped about four houses away and when i got in i told him i was standing on the curb and he passed me up and i also said when i walk to your car you pulled off twice he said i think you should get another uber we're starting off on the wrong foot as i got out i slammed this store and he tried to run over me in front of my wife who was looking out of the door and god is my witness that's why i canceled his trip then when i called for the second over my wife decided cancel that trip to and i just took my vehicle to work i was so distraught that driver needs discipline if i wouldn't have jumped out of the way he would have ran me over it was so bad that my neighbors even came outside because of the screeching of his car
MSG|203| i am not paying for this trip. the driver was not the driver in the picture. there was also a communication barrier to clarify why he was not listed.
MSG|204| when i took this uber trip not to long ago my trip was extended and he was going the wrong way every buddies does the nation i got up at 12 when i said i was supposed be getting home at 11 and i got charged $31 i need this to be disputed
MSG|205| the driver kept going past pick up spot and kept driving around , took way to long
MSG|206| my group ordered two rides one on uber and one on lyft and this guy showed up on both apps and then left and did not cancel with me so we were stuck here waiting and watching his car drive away and leave me hanginf
MSG|207| trip started without being anywhere near my pickup location. so i canceled since i was not in the car.
MSG|208| the driver was still 10 minutes away but i was charged a fee. i needed to get my husband to work by 3. you had an uber that was 5 minutes away but then gave me one that was 11 minutes away. i shouldn't be charged this cancellation fee when they were far away and not close.
MSG|209| again, i expect not to be charged for any of these cancellation fees because time and time again i was matched with the same driver who caused me multiple problems. he made no effort to find me, was not coherently speaking, did not meet me where he told me to meet him twice, and i kept getting him when i tried to get another driver (even in a different spot). i used lyft cause this happened too much with a uber.
MSG|210| i waited for this driver for over 20-minutes i counseled him when i saw that it showed he had picked me up so i canceled
MSG|211| i was never in that car..
MSG|212| no. but i would like my cancellation fee refunded because i didnt feel safe getting in a car that was not register. ive wasted about 30 minutes trying to get a reliable uber today. what the hell is goin on!!!! i am just trying to get to my destination!!!
MSG|213| driver was not driving the car on profile and i didnt feel safe getting in a car that was not registered on uber. i should not be charged a cancellation fee!
MSG|214| i waited nearly 10 minutes for a pick up, and then i saw the driver fly past me then cancel the ride. i then needed to wait for another driver that would take another 5-10 minutes after completing another nearby trip. i should not be penalized for having to wait and then being cancelled on.
MSG|215| too long 20 min wait please refund me
MSG|216| the driver started the ride before he ever picked me up. check where the ride started vs where my pick up location was.
MSG|217| i waited for my uber driver at the location but we never found each other not
MSG|218| driver left me without any reason . i was charged and i would like to have my money refunded please
MSG|219| driver did not have his phone mounted on console. he had  phone in cup holder. not professional.\nhe was waiting for police to come. i just got off a 4 hrs plane ride. very tired. i called another uber.
MSG|220|21pm. her app showed us at 46th accurately while mine did not.
MSG|221| no
MSG|222| the driver called me an idiot!
MSG|223| my driver started this trip before ive even picked me up... i immediately cancelled when i saw that the trip started without me being in the car. i was charged twice for this same trip
MSG|224| i cancelled my trip and i didnt get charged a late fee but i didnt get my uber credits refunded from the trip
MSG|225| my driver was here and when i rode the car, he told me that he could not take me. so unprofessional!!! so i cancelled it right away!
MSG|226| my driver had another male occupant in the front passenger seat. i requested an uberx. when the driver pulled up i told the driver i did not request to have to people in the vehicle including himself. his response was its just my cousin. my mom just died and hes just riding with me. this situation made me feel unsafe to accept a ride from this driver. this action from the driver forced me to cancel the ride and request a new uber driver. this behavior is unacceptable from the driver since i did not request to have any other occupant in the vehicle besides the driver.
MSG|227| i was charged for the ride that i canceled
MSG|228| my driver didnt move towards my pickup  in fact he kept moving away and i know you guys saw that
MSG|229| my driver never picked me up.  i was extremely late and had to order a regular uber at much higher price so i dont want to pay for my next ride.
MSG|230| at the event
MSG|231| false shooting at rolling loud music festival. swat and police on site. driver could not reach me. i just want the cancellation fee back. i do not want credit.
MSG|232| uber driver picked up the wrong person. wothou valodating my name or number watched the uber driver drive padt me and rejected my lhone calles numerous times as i tried to call and tell him he had the wrong person. very unprofessional.
MSG|233| the driver told me to cancel the trip because he didnt want to wait for me at starbucks, then taking me to my other location.
MSG|234| submitted request, said 2 minutes away. waited almost 8 minutes at pickup spot, and the driver did not move towards us. attempted to contact driver, but he lied.
MSG|235| i dont know why i was charged $81.40 when my trip fare was $64.26.
MSG|236| driver dropped me off 10 blocks away from home
MSG|237| i ordered a ride and it was showing that he will arrive in 4 min but at first he was standing at the same place for maybe 10 min then i tried to call him few times but he didnt answer and then he drove away from wher he was standing for another 15 blocks
MSG|238| i was still charged 19.41 for this trip and i do not see a refund on my pending charges of my bank account. i was wondering why i havent gotten my refund when i havent taken this trip.
MSG|239| my driver never showed up, and had started the trip without picking me up
MSG|240| the driver didn't stop when he passed by us (we rose our phone and try to notify him)
MSG|241| i cancelled this ride because my driver did not move for 5 minutes.
MSG|242| driver was a complete asswipe
MSG|243| she couldnt take me to my destination please do not charge me for this
MSG|244| driver said the car is broken and he can not drive
MSG|245| driver said that car is broken
MSG|246| hey i just want to make sure there is. o negative impact to this driver. the one who came to pick me up before him literally pulled away fast & unsafely while my hand was on the door. she is lucky nobody was hurt. incredibly unprofessional and unbecoming of an uber driver
MSG|247| this driver picked up someone else and i couldn't find him and had to cancel
MSG|248| im not complaining about the girl that dropped me off tonight. the driver before her messaged me and asked where i was going. i sent my address and he cancelled my ride. this is not the first time this has happened. the gal that got me was great and i ended up getting her through lyft because of it. how can a driver message you and cancel a ride bc they dont want to go that route? that seems to defeat the point of using this app. i cant access his name. ive been using uber for years. this is the reason i downloaded lyft bc of the same incident. the driver called me and asked where i was going and said he didnt want to travel to plano. any thoughts on this ?
MSG|249| my driver never showed up but still took my trip, and when i texted him that you didnt pick me up why you still took my trip, but he didnt text me back and kept driving so i had to cancel the trip to be able to order another one. can you guys stop allowing drivers to do this kind of thing? its not the first time the driver taking my trip without picking me up
MSG|250| id like my money back, as i cancelled within time and cancelled because i didnt agree to walking. so cancelled. so please refund me. ty
MSG|251| its very frustrating when me and my family is waiting for a uber or i request a uber for a friend and the drivers cancel last min. i dont see why they pick up the trip if they dont want to drive to a certain neighborhood
MSG|252| driver called and said he was a few blocks away from my location waiting for me, but when i told him where i was, he sighed loudly on the phone, and spoke to me as if i, personally was an inconvenience for him. this was very confusing because i was at the designated pick-up point, and he was basically asking me to walk towards the place his last trip ended to save himself time (i waited for him to finish a trip). the location he was at was a very busy four-way intersection so its not easy to stop therei was waiting in a safer place.
MSG|253| driver never picked me up, just drove around in circles and never picked me up! even though he said he did! bullshit!
MSG|254| uber cash
MSG|255| he kept pulling over we asked to play some deferant music he said no and had his dog in the car.
MSG|256| give me my money back
MSG|257| on top of my driver being very very rude i accidentally selected the wrong stop which made him more frustrated! i am paying my money to ride comfortably not for my driver to have an attitude
MSG|258| my diver has been rude from the very begging i step foot into this car!! i refuse to pay 5$ for a 1 mins stop! and he told me he could cancel because it would ruin his bonus i am veryyy upset at this uber driver for being completely rude to me
MSG|259| this man never picked me up, it said he was a minute away and he turned around and then it said 3 minutes and then the ride started as if i was picked up and he never picked me up. im tired of being charged and having this same issue with uber. i want to be reimbursed, not uber credit
MSG|260| the ride was started with out me, and he never picked me up - he just drove right passed me... ban him!
MSG|261| i didn't even order this ride at all. i want my funds to be credited back into my account asap before i call corporate.
MSG|262| i can't reset password.  on friday 5/17 i ordered a ride from dallas love field, the instructions said to go down to area 4. that's where i went, but when the driver called me she said she was on the upper level and couldn't come to the lower level. i  cancelled the ride but was charged the whole amount. i don't think that's fair. it's not my fault your driver doesn't have the proper credentials to be at the airport. i ordered a second ride and it was great. i should not have to pay for mohammed, the first ride. and why would you charge for 2 rides going to the same place?
MSG|263| drivers eta was not accurate, ubers gps system was incorrect and the number jumped from 10 mins away to 21 mins away this required me cancel and request a new car as it would have made me late for work. i tried to call the driver but nobody picked up, please refund.
MSG|264| i was charged a $3 cancellation fee again
MSG|265| my driver was too far
MSG|266| my driver kept calling me asking me where i was even though i didnt leave from the location that i called for the uber from. it was very confusing and he made it seem like i had done sometbing wrong. eventually i had to cancel because of timing.
MSG|267| he was making wrong weird turns and was supposed to be here 2 minutes before i cancelled and then he was still 4 min away! i have to go! i dont have time to wait around
MSG|268| no
MSG|269| this driver accept my request and sifon like she picked me up but she did not!! my uber map start to showing me my route but i was not in the car??? so please dont give a credit those lier drivers and please do some serious investigation. pay my money back!
MSG|270| the driver never showed up...tried to contact multiple times no response. i couldnt wait anymore. so booked again immediately. please refund the cancellation fee
MSG|271| i waited 10min for a supposed 5 min eta and the driver just stopped across the street, marked the ride as started and drove past me. then when he was all the way down the street cancelled it. now i have to wait another 10min for another more expensive uber with an ice cream cake.
MSG|272| car and plate not match the photo in the app and you charge me five dollars i need refund
MSG|273| driver showed and said he couldnt take our party. we had 6 the same amount we had on the way over!
MSG|274| this is unacceptable
MSG|275| he was an asshole he cursed me out infront of people and blamed uber pool for not being on the spot you guys should take him off of uber
MSG|276| i never purchased the order and you guys never gave me back the money to my bank account and i dont use the uber app at all so theres no point on giving me credit for the app i just want my $28 that uber owes me because i never used the ride
MSG|277| not that i know of
MSG|278| i have not been able to book a trip n it ysed my promo without me even using a trip
MSG|279| i would  like my funds to go back to my account
MSG|280| told her i needed the other uber driver and asked her to cancel and she said i keep picking the wrong car but i am going to pick up food and her car has signs saying no food allowed so i kept canceling her rides
MSG|281| the driver never showed up so i had to take a shuttle even after i called him
MSG|282| to whom this may concern, we ordered an uber to pick us up at 330. the driver, deandre, accepted our ride but never moved or headed our way. we were on our way to the airport. he never came. we could not order another ride because deandre did not cancel our ride and we did not want to incur the $5 fee. we waited for deandre for 45 minutes before we ordered a lyft. i am disappointed in his service and your policy. i understand why they are in place but this is not our fault. thank you. dr. shaileen araki.
MSG|283|57.  also i had the same driver when i needed to request another ride.
MSG|284| i wad waiting for this driver and it said he was 8 min away. i noticed him driving away on the app from where he was supposed to pick me up from.  then he was 13 minutes away, then 14 minutes away, and then 16 minutes away. he drove completely in a different direction and i think he did that so that i would cancel the trip he basically left me stranded in a bad area.
MSG|285| this guy literally saw me was on a green light i was waiting for him to pull up on the corner dude literally speed off what is going on with this uber man your people are super rude and unprofessional
MSG|286| i thought gold members can re book within 15 mins and the prior cancellation would be wav
MSG|287| driver pulled away as i was approaching vehicle like a scam attempt.
MSG|288| my driver told me he couldnt take me and my partner because it was 2 of us.. i did not understand it at all because why would he tell us that! and i tried requesting another rider but it kept connecting the same driver. i dont think i should be charged for canceling!
MSG|289| it was my first time using uber. i set up a pick up of my elderly parents to take them to the airport. my dad is 90 years old and my mom is 82 diagnosed with cancer. i set up the ride ahead of time on tuesday, may 7th for 12pm thursday may 9th. the driver never showed up. luckily they had a family friend there to help them an arrange another ride. they can not do it themselves since they only have a flip phone. thankfully there was someone there to help them. this was upsetting since i was not there.
MSG|290| erica the driver on this after she was assigned to me texted me to tell me she had a flat tire and she would have to cancel me. the only way i was to close out and request another driver to take us to the airport was to cancel that ride first. then i received an $8.17 receipt from you. please refund this charge.
MSG|291| the app switched address from 210 union ave to 210 union st which was incorrect pick up
MSG|292| the estimate of arrival of the driver was 6 while the estimate of actually getting to the destination was 10! i didnt think these two number quite align with each other and i was in a hurry. so it didnt make sense to wait that long for the driver to arrive
MSG|293| disputing this cancellation fee. the app made it appear i was already pricked up, but the vehicle had not arrived yet.
MSG|294| i never took this ride nor committed to it. my actual trip was in a different car with different driver.
MSG|295| fighting with passenger. twice made a dangerous turns.
MSG|296| my driver wasnt moving toward me and neither was the time to pick up.
MSG|297| the driver is too far. i want to get a refund.
MSG|298| why cant i book a ride! the app says no cars available. but the fare was taken from my account. is there a problem for the reason i cant get a ride. this is inconvenient
MSG|299| i was incorrectly charged for this. on the map, it appeared the same driver was already driving away from me. i cancelled and called a new one right away and it turned out to be the same driver anyway.
MSG|300| the driver does not speak any english. you should not hire people who are unable to communicate - what if there is an accident or a situation that requires them to communicate their location or the situation? they wont be able to!
MSG|301| we had a 3 hour drive from sfo airport to fresno. 10 minutes into the trip the driver decided he could take us any more so we had to get a new uber driver
MSG|302| i'm pissed at this system right now. apparently you guys took my 5 dollar uber cash for a ride that never even got to me or messaged me. he accepted the ride out in livermore before even driving to my house and picking me up. i need those credits back and my 2.60 from my card
MSG|303| the app made the driver go to my dropoff location instead of my pickup.
MSG|304| longer than expected and not answering call
MSG|305| the car never arrived to the pick up point for over 20 minutes and i had to cancel. but im being charged an outrageous amount for a trip i didnt take
MSG|306| thanks.
MSG|307| my driver never showed, i called multiple times an he didnt answer i had to cancel my ride an still got charged. he never showed up or answered
MSG|308| the driver could not understand the use of the app and told us he was at the arrival address and not the pick up address. the app showed his car near the pickup address but it took more than 10 minutes for him to start heading our way so we canceled
MSG|309| my bank statement says its been charged twice for this trip
MSG|310| this driver went to the wrong address and would come to my locate. please refund.
MSG|311| i just looked in this app to see if uber was work yet. i had $20.89 now o have $7.39 something iber is robben now! i'm bail inn enforcement i will contact who i need to contact if this money don't go back i haven't not used this service weeks because nothing works the truth show this as well last trip was a benz jeep which was wrong and guy charged his picture do not play with me about this!!
MSG|312| i was charged for a cancellation fee for my other trip even though my driver wasnt moving and a waited a good amount of time. i want to be refunded for that or credited for this trip.
MSG|313| see above.
MSG|314| silver volkswagen jetta
MSG|315| i attempted to call my driver. he did not pickup. he circled the location. three times, never turning onto my street. i waited 10 minutes. im not sure what i was supposed to de except cancel. i dont believe a 5 dollar fee is fair. id appreciate someone reviewing the charge
MSG|316| i didn't even get on the car. driver didn't picked me up and fled away. i had to call another uber right after
MSG|317| my driver never picked me up
MSG|318| the driver cancelled the trip. please refund the fee.
MSG|319| pickup location was wrong, driver didnt come
MSG|320| during my trip i realized that i had an emergency at home and needed to go back immediately. i asked my driver to turn around, he did not understand english and continued driving. he continued driving for about 10 minutes while i tried to communicate to him that i had an emergency and needed to return home. he finally pulled over. when he did he called uber and argued with someone in spanish for another 5-10 minutes. after he got off the phone i asked him to please bring me home but he kept repeating something i did not understand. he then put something that wasnt my address in his gps and began driving. i then asked him to stop and got out of the car. \ni was left standing on the side of route 146n for 25 minutes while i waited for a new uber.\n\nthis experience was terrifying and dangerous. i am requesting a full refund of the $34.11 that i was charged for that trip. it was absolutely unacceptable and unsafe. im questioning whether i will ever travel with uber again.
MSG|321| i was charged 2 cancellation fees due to me trying to get a ride and uber app wasnt not connecting me to a driver. twice
MSG|322| i requested my uber he was taking twice the amount of the the estimated time and i tried to call and message him repeatedly and he wouldn't pick up his phone or respond
MSG|323| driver took to long and driving away, requested another uber
MSG|324|55am and the driver did not show up in time
MSG|325| the app updated its route after i had walked to the pickup spot and had been waiting 5 min. when it updated, i was no longer a pickup on the route, but was still ending at my apt. i called the uber driver to confirm that i was going to be picked up and he said i wasnt and to cancel because i wouldnt be charged. so i did and had to wait for another car.
MSG|326| wrong pick-up location
MSG|327| went from 8 to 13 minutes didnt move at all
MSG|328| i want the next ride i took refunded because i was using commuter benefits card - and this guy kept driving the wrong direction til i had no choice but to pay using my own card.
MSG|329| my driver originally said 3 minutes. then it jumped to 10 minutes
MSG|330| the driver canceled my trip with 1.27 to arrival tim
MSG|331| hello!  can a manager please contact me i am extremely disappointed with a scheduled pickup i had this morning
MSG|332| i did not take this trip the uber driver never picked me up
MSG|333| i was never picked up to begin with. yet, the driver had me as in the car. i shouldnt be charged any cancellation fees, i called the driver and it didnt help.
MSG|334| rude would not accept ride. would not cancel i dont want to be charged
MSG|335| his license plate did not match the app.  i took a photo and it was cjd3021.  when i confronted him, he admitted that he changed the license plate.  following safety protocol i did not get in the car.  if he was able to give me a bad rating i would like to vehemently protest it.  how do i find out if he rated me?  i would hope that you would not allow this driver to rate me, and also given that you are advising every passenger to check the license plate, that this driver explain why his license plate does not match his profile.
MSG|336| she was so slow and she can't find another co rider easily.she wasted my money & time.
