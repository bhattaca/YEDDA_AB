MSG|675| driver got lost twice trying to find my location. i finally had to cancel after the second time he didnt show up.
MSG|676| the driver side swiped a seemingly parked car
MSG|677| i was charged the full price for this trip. i don't have any memory of the canceled trip, but seeing that i was charged for 2 trips when i only used one is very uncalled for
MSG|678| you gave me a driver who was still doing another trip, and the ride said 7 minutes away. after 5 minutes it still said 7 minutes. this is the time i need to go to work. refund me.
MSG|679| didnt take me to where i was going. i cancelled him because he had to get someone else. need my refund back on my card.
MSG|680| dude was not there
MSG|681| my driver picked up the wrong passenger and i could not contact her, so i cancelled the ride. please refund the cancelled ride.
MSG|682| driver was driving away from my location. after waiting 15 minutes, he was 20 minutes away. did not answer my messages or phone calls. had no choice but to cancel.
MSG|683| driver wouldnt tell us if he was coming or cancel.  started driving opposite way and we were stuck waiting for him out in the rain in the dark.
MSG|684| my driver was going away from my destination i told him to turn around and he kept going in the direction i told  him not to go ..and i wasnt picked up i want a refund of mr cancelling
MSG|685| my driver did not move towards my location and after 8 minutes texted me to ask me where i was going
MSG|686| first time i'm getting "no cars available" it's sunday morning!
MSG|687| hi. i am very upset. my driver was extremely rude and refused to take us and made us cancel. he should have cancelled if he had an issue and was very very rude.
MSG|688| driver asked me to meet at a different location for time sake, i agreed and walked to other location only to have him get upset with me for not understanding what he meant. i felt very uncomfortable and canceled the trip because i didnt want to handle the awkward conversation if i chose to ride with him.
MSG|689| i would like a refund i was charged the full amount and my ride was delayed and the time kept increase it went from 5 minutes to 13 minutes to 15 minutes and i couldnt wait that long
MSG|690| my driver was not moving in my direction
MSG|691| my pick up location was wrong so i had to cancel
MSG|692| hi! yesterday i requested my uber to go back home, while waiting for the driver my app said he had already picked me up, which wasnt true, i called the driver he said he was going to cancel it but he didnt, kept calling and didnt answer. this is the worst experience i had, because i had to pay for that trip, and the next one so i could get home. i demand a full refund of the service as soon as possible, have screen shots of the messages i sent to the driver and that i was still at my pick up point and he wasnt there.
MSG|693| they never picked me up!
MSG|694| i didnt get a ride. uber driver passed in front of me and my uber showed my trip had been started. i was waiting for her 10 mins and she totally lost my location since she told uber that i was in a ride with her. i was late for my appointment because of it.  i need to refund my fee.
MSG|695| my trips have not been able to load for a few days now.
MSG|696| horrible driver. almost crashed twice. he is either drunk or sleeping behind the wheel.
MSG|697| driver was too far, had to cancel.
MSG|698| this trip was canceled but on my credit card account there is a charge fee for $3.10 twice i did two more rides yesterday which are more expensive and are reflected i have the only credit card account please roll these off
MSG|699| wouldn't cancel my trip and spoke rudely while giving me b.s. excuses
MSG|700| did not take the trip tried to contact the driver because it said he picked me up but he didnt
MSG|701| the gps location was still wrong on the pickup, had to reorder again but the 3rd time worked
MSG|702| she did not show up, there was only 1 minute left, and cancelled it
MSG|703| my driver had broken doors and took shape turns and we almost got hit by a car because he was not paying attention
MSG|704| i didnt cancel the trip the driver cancelled my trip
MSG|705| yea
MSG|706| my uber drive picked up someone else and took forever to get back to me. in addition, the location status shown the driver was at the same spot for a really long time. i called the driver to see can she get to me under 3 min.
MSG|707| the mobile app said that he would be there in one minute and i waited another three minutes and i had to go to a wedding
MSG|708| my driver wasnt close to me but the ride started and i was charged $3
MSG|709| no
MSG|710| she asked me my name without giving me hers and when i said my name it seemed as though she wasnt expecting anyone but still asked me to get in the car. behavior seemed off in general, not friendly at all.
MSG|711| the driver told me the area was too crowded and asked me to cancel since he wouldnt be able to pull into the parking lot
MSG|712| he didnt pick me up and he showed like he picked me
MSG|713| i got charged already for the trip and then get charged a cancellation fees or my driver sitting at 10-9 minutes away for 10 minutes i it's self. he stayed in the same area for almost 10 minutes after i ordered the uber. i should not have been charged a cancellation fee.
MSG|714| why did i get charge 7.20 for the trip and it was 4 dolars
MSG|715| i was picked up from the bottom of my drive way today by this driver and i asked if there was a reason why she did not pull up to the door. she said she doesnt pull up to driveways. i was surprised because the uber drivers i have called have picked me up from my driveway. i asked if that was an uber rule but she said no it was hers. you could tell she had an attitude and during the ride and while i was literally falling asleep she said i canceled the ride and got angry telling me to get out of her car in the middle of the road. i refused to get out and maintained i did not cancel the ride. she pulls to the next street and hops out of her car while cussing me out and tries to grab my bag in an effort to physically remove me from the car. at that point i call the police and the police asked that i have her maintain her location and to wait for them. she gets on the phone and once she got confirmation from uber to complete the ride she decides to drive off against the officers order. she eventually stops as i kept telling her to pull over and we were met by the cops. needless to say she is is poor representation of professionalism and i strongly believe she is in the wrong profession. i hope she can manage her emotions as things could always escalated if cooler heads do not prevail
MSG|716|15am, no driver had picked up the ride. as a result, i missed my train.  please credit my account. thank you.
MSG|717| this driver sandra license plate number ae40335 black nissan sentra never picked me up at my location she drove passed my location twice and continued elsewhere and i was waiting over 15 minutes she did not answer my phone call after several tries so i want my fee returned immediately.
MSG|718| his pin stopped moving tried calling him could not get through. i was waiting at my location and we couldnt connect so want a refund
MSG|719| my driver continues to say they were at pickup location and clearly they were not
MSG|720| no more details i can share
MSG|721| i never took the trip
MSG|722| the map said 3mins i called and text the driver i did they any respond from her i had to cancel and call another uber which mad me late for my appointment please look just not this thanks
MSG|723| i didnt cancel the trip because i wanted to the address was incorrect . how is that my fault ?
MSG|724| my driver drove by my stop to pick me up and continue dri
MSG|725| the app kept telling me that he picked me up and was en route to my destination however he never picked me up. malik also had an attitude when i told him about it and he asked me to cancel my ride.
MSG|726| i was trying to get a ride from her then my ride canceled and now i cant i use my uber
MSG|727| the driver was 3 minutes away, i waited almost 15 minutes and did not get picked up. he drove further and further from my location with no intent on coming to pick me up. please give me my money back. this person didnt even have the decency to cancel the trip. very annoying!
MSG|728| hello, it wasnt this driver, but i am afraid that the driver that cancelled my ride right before him may be involved in a scam to ignore riders and force them to cancel in order to get the $5 charge. i was waiting outside for them and trying to contact them once i noticed them driving away from me. they did not contact me back and just kept driving away and ignoring me, and after 30 minutes of me not canceling they finally cancelled the ride. just thought this would be good of you guys to be aware of. her name was aleyda and her license plate was 5cy327
MSG|729| the driver never arrived at my destination but still put in the app as picked up and drove away. unacceptable.
MSG|730| i wasnt even on the ride i want all my money back no cancellation fee because she didnt even pick me up and i called her and told her why it says im on the ride when im still waiting for her she said she was three minutes away, she didnt pick me up im late for school now i want my money back no cancellation fee period
MSG|731| the drivers location reflected my own when i was outside and he wasnt present. we sat and waited calling the guy to no avail.
MSG|732| i called the uber but it wasnt moving, i tried calling to confirm they were coming but he never picked up. i had to cancel and call a new one.
MSG|733|   - after ordering the first uberpool (supposed to be waiting for 8 minutes but waited for 12 ) i went to stand in the rain for the car but the driver didnt pick me up. he was supposed to pick up 2 passengers and only took 1.  i called the driver and he said he will pick me up after he drop off the first one.  he never showed up. after 15mn wait i cancelled the trip and order another one.  please advise.  thanks  cyril coisne
MSG|734| driver repeatedly ignored messages and phone calls.
MSG|735| driver started ride even though he was at a different terminal. ended up waiting 15 mins for him to just drive around in circles. had to cancel ride after telling him repeatedly which terminal and door i was in.
MSG|736| uber app froze and driver had to cancel trip
MSG|737| why did i get charged for cancelling 10 seconds after i ordered it not happy at all
MSG|738| i added a trip. i cancel just the added trip and the uber system canceld the whole trip and charge me the same price
MSG|739| driver was stopped. passenger door was opened and another driver hit the open door.
MSG|740| hi, i was never picked up for his yet charged for it. can you look into cancellation /refund request and revert.
MSG|741| hi there. when i got into the uber the driver refused to tell me who he was there for and then kicked me out of his car and made me feel extremely u comfortable. with all of the new rules going on with getting into uber, this made me feel extremely uncomfortable and his behavior was very unprofessional.
MSG|742| first of all my address is 93 winding wood dr, sayreville. secondly your charge was 28$ so why would you take 38$ from my card. thirdly this is becoming a concurrent behavior from you guys that i always have to dispute my fare and i am so tired of these
MSG|743| i didnt request a ride need my money on my card never called the uber
MSG|744| the driver came to my pickup location and dropped a girl off, but never picked me up.  she did accept me as in the car but i never was.
MSG|745| my driver was not driving toward my location.  i took 3 screenshot photo of my driver driving away.  if you need me to email you the photos please send me your email address so i can show you the evidence.  i also booked the ride for 5.54 and had had to cancel it because he was driving away, then i tried to booked another uber driver the rate went up to 6.87.  thats when i decided to ride lyft instead.  please reimburse the cancellation fee as its the drivers fault that i cancelled and not mine.
MSG|746| my driver not only took way longer than 4 minutes (the expected eta) but 8 minutes later he had gotten farther from my location. i shouldnt be charged any fee and am upset. this is awful service.
MSG|747| driver never showed up
MSG|748| driver extended the time for pick up. in going to the airport this wasnt a good solution for me. when it went from 6 minutes to 9. unacceptable
MSG|749| i was charged for the ride and a cancellation fee, despite the uber driving never picking me up. i can see i was charged on my bank statement.
MSG|750| yes i am completely disheartened as i am from out of town but visiting my family back in tx. i am a disabled veteran so i only take lyfts and ubers living on the east coast .i purchased a brand new lawn mower that was brand new in the box and myself and a home depot employee were outside to meet the uber driver who very rudely said he would not take me 1.2 miles to my parents home whom i visiting he so rudely told us bc the home depot employee who was goo g to help me load the box into his large vehicle that if u put the seat down it will fit in there . the gentleman retorted that he had been driving for uber forever and never seen anything like this i love on the east coast and have been utilizing u all since inception when u were in the dc market and have never had any issues such as this! then the gentleman refused to cancel the uber as to be malicious and to make me pay more than the uber was even going to cost to go 1.2 mi down the road
MSG|751| i was still at my pick up location and he never canceled i never got into the uber
MSG|752| i was waiting at the pick-up location for my uber to arrive. i never saw the car arrive or stop. the driver never contacted me. then i saw that the driver was en route to my destination but i was not in the car, so i cancelled it midway through the trip.
MSG|753| i ordered my uber and i was waiting at my destination but he never came to pick me up and i tried contacting him but there was no response. he never picked me up from my location and he made it seem as he picked me up but in reality did not. i believe i was charged unfairly and would appreciate a refund. i will gladly appreciate it.
MSG|754| pls refund because driver didn't come in my direction
MSG|755| i made a mistake to call the uber and i wanted a different driver
MSG|756| hello! i canceled this trip in a timely manner and would appreciate a refund
MSG|757| the driver started the ride before even getting me. i was waiting at my specified location and the trip started without me.  so i canceled my ride and if i am charged for this type of service i will take lyft from now on. currently i use your service when on business trips.
MSG|758| the driver accepted my request and never came. i called him many times and he first picked up the phone and then hanged up when i asked are you coming??? possibly he picked up the phone because he couldnt see my number and when he realized it was me he hanged up. i noticed on the map he went the other way and still he didnt cancel the trip. i assume he was waiting for me to cancel in order to get $4 cancelation fee. he was horrible! he wasted my time.
MSG|759| you guys still took money off my card and i canceled the trip...i need my 4.52 put back on my card
MSG|760| 
MSG|761| after 3 minutes he moved farther from the pickup point and did not move after that
MSG|762| driver was very abusive for getting 2 mins late; and we have to stop the car and leave. totally unexpected behavior and attitude. uber should take some action against her.
MSG|763| driver threw my luggage on the ground and tried hitting me with vehicle!
MSG|764| driver was completely rude, so i cancelled trip he threw my luggage on the street and the proceeding in trying to hit me with his vehicle.
MSG|765| i did not complete the whole trip to be charged the full fare i got dropped off up the block
MSG|766| the bus takes half the time for the same distance while stopping at each corner in traffic. he took the longest route possible & didn't listen when other suggestions where made. i missed my appointment. then i have to pay more? he didn't stop for me. i got out at his next pick up & walked plus i'm handicap.
MSG|767| i called to ask where he was and he said he was not coming to get me and asked me to cancel it. i told him to cancel it so i wouldnt be charged a fee and he yelled at me and said he could not cancel it. rude.
MSG|768| my driver never found me to pick me up but instead said he did in the app and started driving toward my destination without me
MSG|769| i canceled this trip. i now have a charge on my credit card account of $22.92 and this is so annoying. its been reflected on my account. why do you guys charge randomly on people?
MSG|770| never showed up. and i walked to the destination he was at.
MSG|771| not my pickup or drop off not my trip
MSG|772| the driver pulled up to my destination and as i walked up to the car to open the door and the driver drove off and continued the trip as if i was in the car. i had to end up canceling the damn trip. very upset about this.
MSG|773| driver dropped someone else off at my hotel and then started my trip without picking me up and drive away
MSG|774| the driver was going in the opposite direction from my destination. i felt extremely unsafe!
MSG|775| please refund. the driver pin was stuck in one place.
MSG|776| i went out side and he didnt even wait a minute
MSG|777| driver picked the wrong people and did respond to my text in that regard or phone call please refund this charge
MSG|778| my driver kept moving farther and farther from my destination
MSG|779|41. your driver is fraudulently marking people as picked up!
MSG|780| absolutely not paying this fare!! the route added 15 min of unnecessary route which was ridiculous!
MSG|781| i do not understand why they charged me 25 dollars if the uber was canceled
MSG|782| i didn't cancel the trip. he never showed up to the pick up location
MSG|783| he didnt pick up me
MSG|784| i had this person twice and i was in a hurry and dont appreciate rides being 15 mins away when i see  cars right by my apartment. what kind of shit is tht. u guys always making me late for work. i want refund for both rides her names maria and i got her twice i want a refund for those two rides
MSG|785| the driver never arrived, he just started driving away from the place and i had to cancel. check the driving history to confirm that
MSG|786| after messaging the driver and waiting 15m for a response. ignoring my phone call. and not moving an inch, i was forced to cancel. this is unprofessional and rude.
MSG|787| the driver was 30 min away and i asked her to cancel and she ignored my response
MSG|788| i had two stops, i was in the house for less than 3 minutes and he drove off because he didnt want to take me to huntersville, which was 20 mins away. shouldnt have accepted the ride if he didnt want to drive.
MSG|789|45 for uber to charge me a $6 cancellation fee. i would appreciate this driver be reprimanded posthaste.
MSG|790| my driver called me, confirmed location, claimed he needed my destination address, then proceeded to drive away and did not answer my calls back to him to ask where he was going. this forced me to cancel.
MSG|791| the uber driver did not speak english. he brought me back to the starter location even though my destination address said to go to a restaurant. he told me to cancel and i told him that he already got my money and that he should take me to the right destination. i got charged more than what it said and its probably bc he told me to cancel it. i cant even review his stupid account bc he asked me to cancel and i did which i shouldnt bc i would give him the lowest amount of money! communication wasnt even there because he kept using a translator to tell me what to do. im so annoyed at this.
MSG|792| trip was taking too long
MSG|793| i got out of the car earlier than my destination and my driver didnt stop the ride.
MSG|794| i want different car and driver, i waited a long time to see the driver. and it still needs 11mins for driver to arrive. so i want to change the driver
MSG|795| i just cancel the trip because the driver was rude and in the wrong place and was charging me wait time
MSG|796| i put 2 riders on mistake it was just me im sorry but it was only 8.05$ not 10.35
MSG|797| honestly i waited outside for over 5 minutes for an uber pool in an absolute downpour only to have the driver cancel on me as he was finally pulling up. uber updated the trip to a new driver who was 7 minutes away and at that point i just canceled because i had already been waiting. by then fares had risen even more and i ended up taking a more expensive uber. what is the point of watching the trip progress only to have the driver cancel when he finally arrives?
MSG|798| 3154
MSG|799| the full amount was taken off my card , when the driver never showed and cancelled the ride
MSG|800| our uber driver had a problem with his car and i cancelled it half of our trip i saw that i was chargerd $9+ but on my bank account i was charged for this trip for $22+ so how can i refund my remaining money? thank you
MSG|801| i walked from the accident to my destination
MSG|802| payment was credited to uber funds instead of refunded to credit card. please refund to credit card 1002 or change to 2000
MSG|803| you should not allow him to drive for uber
MSG|804| i havent take this trip ! and the driver was trying to cheat me . he told me to cancel
MSG|805| the ride was a pool for $20. it now shows $32 was charged. why the fare difference i didn't go that far a d it was a pool trip
MSG|806| this driver did not pick me up at all. i was charged for no service at all. and when i called the driver he hung up on me 5 times. horrible representative
MSG|807| i want a refund
MSG|808| i originally cancelled this ride because the driver had started the ride before myself and my friends were in the car. i cancelled the ride and reordered the ride. he picked it up again, and i immediately cancelled it before i was charged. i tried again but he was the only driver in the area. he took a very long time to get to my destination although i gave him verbal directions over the phone and my pin was in the correct location and we were outside waiting.
MSG|809| i was charged for a ride that i was told by your customer service line that i would not be charged for ! this driver made me feel very unsafe to the point where i felt like i almost had to jump out of the car because he was not trying to take me to my location i requested . he kept making comments about my body and how pretty i was and as it got closer to my destination he kept speeding up the car . he kept trying to get on the highway or take back streets that i didnt know to take me somewhere else that wasnt my destination . and he would ignore my suggestions to stay on the gps route . ive never had an issue with uber before and i dont know why im being charged for a ride that i was told would be refunded . and i want my money back .
MSG|810| instead of following the gps took me the wrong way and madeleine feel very unsafe and refused to follow the gps once i asked him to . he kept saying i know the city very well. i dont feel as though i should have to pay it because he turned my 26 minute ride into almost an hour and thats ridiculous
MSG|811| my moms card was charged $17. 23...not $5 for cancellation. please correct and return to her card.
MSG|812| why couldn't i see the option for riding with other people to share cost. carpool.
MSG|813| hello, this morning during my trip the driver that i had caught a flat tire and had to cancel the trip so i had to pay for another ride. i would like for the cancellation/trip fee to be refunded fully. thank you.
MSG|814| my driver started charging me prior to ever picking me up. dustin was 5 minutes away from picking me up, yet must have told the app that he had picked me up. i then was charged $13, which is absolutely absurd since dustin was still 5 minutes away and i was already getting charged. i was never picked up and to be charged for this is unacceptable.
MSG|815| this driver was 10 minutes away- 2 minutes were spent locating her and i cancelled immediately - she never moved in my direction she was over a bridge. please refund this fee, i need to get to work and i didnt inconvenience anyone
MSG|816| driver did not move towards my location and i'm not late for work. had to use lyft which is really disappointing
MSG|817| the driver was at the total different location he was at the totally different side of my building waiting i tried call him he hung up on me after couple of times ringing and since he would not answer my call i ran all the way to the location and when i was at the location he was already left and he didn't even give me a text or call before leaving or even answer any of my calls. i have never felt this way using uber before. he wasn't even there at the location. but in the ap it showed that i was already in his car and on my map he was moving or something. the point is he was never at the location of pickup and he never answered my call and hung up on me . and he left without even without a text . i was never close to his car. so hard to communicate with driver when he doesn't even know where the pick up destination is.
MSG|818| the drivers were changed during the waiting period and so was the pickup point.
MSG|819| i asked the driver to move up a bit because the pickup would require me to step ankle deep into a puddle and he furiously drove off without canceling the ride, waiting for me to cancel so i would receive the cancellation fee. im driving away, he almost ran over my foot and was so violent, he could have caused me serious physical harm. this is not a driver who should be on the road. he could do so much worse.
MSG|820| shouldnt charge cancellation fee
MSG|821| my diver was super unprofessional super rude his car smelled like drugs it smelled like weed and he kicked me out i waste too much money on uber to just let money go to waste
MSG|822| i cancelled in less than a minute after request. driver was 12 mins away and driving in other direction from me when i saw the request go through.
MSG|823| the driver started the trip without me being on the car. i called him to tell him about my pickup location but he didnt understand. he was not supposed to start the trip without me being on the car. please i need a full refund to that trip
MSG|824| my card was charged for a trip and the driver never notified me upon arrival
MSG|825| he didn't arrive for 15 min and he did not pick up the phone also.car also did not move forward for 15 min
MSG|826| driver called me asked me to cancel. he mentioned he doesnt want to drive uber pool. when i asked to cancel himself he refused and cut the phone call. it was unprofessional.
MSG|827| i need my money back i never got my ride it wa 7 something  please
MSG|828| photos available. car was totally destroyed.
MSG|829| five minutes after trip was scheduled,  i received a message that driver arrived.  i did not see him anywhere and called him twice, however he did not answer.  i sent a message and he did not respond.  i made a screenshot of my message and calls to him. after he was nonresponsive,  i  decided to request another uber, and that driver arrived within seven minutes.
MSG|830| i had no fee but i'm very unhappy that the driver didn't wait and left seconds after arriving while i walked towards the car (i'm hurt so i can't run)
MSG|831| the uber did not arrive yet the app told me that the uber had picked me up. i did not see the uber vehicle and did not enter the car. i had to cancel the uber becuase the car left without me but acted as if i had been picked up.
