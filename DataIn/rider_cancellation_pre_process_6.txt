MSG|832| somebody else took my ride, my driver was already on to picking up the next rider and i wasnt in the car.
MSG|833| idk
MSG|834| driver did not come to my location but picked me up on the app. i tried calling multiple times and texting as well asking. him to cancel since he did not actually pick me up. he read the texts but did not respond and also ignored my calls. i saw on the app he just sat in a location until i had to cancel and get charged for the ride. i would like to get my money back for this ride
MSG|835| i never took this ride. the driver didnt show up and he still said he picked me up
MSG|836| my driver was so unprofessional! showed up and out of no where decided he didnt want to drive us to our destination, was rude and left us stranded! totally unacceptable and i do not deserve to be charged!
MSG|837| i thought i hit the cancel button right away and exited out of the app. when i reopened it minutes later, i noticed that the cancellation never went through. i had ordered the uber by mistake. i would like to have the cancellation fee returned.
MSG|838| the driver would not answer my calls and would not drive toward my location
MSG|839| my driver started the ride without me and was not responding me on the chat
MSG|840| someone else took my trip
MSG|841| i got charged for cancelling a trip but the driver reported that i was in the vehicle before she ever got to me. i waited over 20 minutes but she never showed. i now have a charge for a $5.00 ride from folsom to sacramento with georgia - that never happened and i had to request a new car.
MSG|842| use my venmo account
MSG|843| i waited for over an hour for the driver, called 13 times and sent 3 messages.  if he would have contacted me at some point i could have made other plans.
MSG|844| the driver started the trip but i never got in the car
MSG|845| it shows $0 here but in my bank account i been charged twice for $7
MSG|846| he didn't pick when he saw i don't have baby car seat. pls return my amount
MSG|847| i never got in the car but on the app it said i was on route. once i realized someone else was in my uber i cancelled and was charged
MSG|848| my driver took over an hour to get to me. i would like at least half of my money back.
MSG|849| i requested the uber from 2930 okeechobee blvd to 4130 bear lakes court, while standing at 2930 okeechobee blvd waiting for the uber i saw that it was moving towards 4130 bear lakes court and i was not in the vehicle, so i cancelled it
MSG|850| i never got in the car with her and she started the trip which is fraud
MSG|851| he is too old to be driving was driving severly under the speed limit and appeared to not be able to see well. he also stopped in the middle of a green light intersection and yelled at me when i asked him if he was ok to drive. worst driver i have ever had.
MSG|852| my driver not show up like 40 minutes  i need my money back
MSG|853| the car was not moving, and when i tried to cancel right away the app just froze for a good 30 secs and then said i was 5 seconds over the cancellation period.... i'm a good customer, i shouldn't have to pay 5$ on a guy who wasn't moving over 5 seconds....i would really appreciate it if you guys could let that one go?
MSG|854| i was waiting at a destination (which i was correctly picked up from on my next trip) and this driver had not yet shown up. when i checked my phone to see what the new eta was, it said i was already in the car with the driver and on my way to my destination. i was never picked up. i was miles away from the alleged pick up destination on the receipt.
MSG|855| i was never picked up but it showed that i was. i had to request i new ride because i was never picked up
MSG|856| he never called to cancel trip had to call 3 times just to make sure if he was coming or not he said it was too far and hanged up.
MSG|857| because of you guys recent situations my cousin was walking me to the car to make sure the ride was the correct driver (she was never going to get in the car with me. however before i could explain that to him he said he could not accommodate me and he pulled off. had he let me explain i wouldve told him that. this was very unprofessional and i would like a refund because there was no fault on my part.
MSG|858| driver lied, did not pick me up, flew right in front of me, but said he picked me up on the app, not answering my calls, and i had no choice but to cancel, his behavior is ready shady. he does this so he wont be the one cancelling, and still getting the money. i want my money back!!!!!!
MSG|859| i paid for a pool ride for two people. and this driver was very rude claiming we had a ride for only one person. he told us to get another uber even though we ordered an uber for two. very unprofessional. we were in the uber for literally 30 seconds and this happened.
MSG|860| hi, i canceled this order right away after i booked, why there is a cancel fee??  i cancelled it because this driver was in manhattan coming to brooklyn to pick me up, i was in brooklyn! its ridiculous waiting!
MSG|861| i had been waiting and i was not picked up
MSG|862| i called driver never arrived or answered. i called 3 times
MSG|863| uber wanted me to walk very very far with groceries. cannot carry
MSG|864| driver dropped me off in a different location
MSG|865| this trip is showing as cancelled but we completed the trip with this driver so i want to make sure they receive payment.
MSG|866| i paid the driver $20.00 cash instead of taking the ride thru uber which was cancelled so he was still paid plus paid again thru me with you guys
MSG|867| i need reimbursement. the driver accepted the drive and then started it before arriving and then asked me to cancel it, saying that if i cancel it with this excuse i wouldn't be charged.
MSG|868| the uber was supposed to be 4 minutes away, 5 minutes later it said the same thing. my destination was only 10 minutes away so i decided to walk. its a heavy traffic time so i understand, but the eta should have reflected that. i want a refund for the fee.
MSG|869| i got this trip after my previous driver ignored our stop and kept driving and rather then getting a different  driver at the same location i got a driver to pick me up at 10th street.
MSG|870| the driver took money from my account of 26.94 and i paid cancellation fee already
MSG|871| i did not take this trip
MSG|872| i was charged two times 8.94. i cancelled after 1 minute
MSG|873| my driver never showed up and now im late to work and i dont know what to do please help
MSG|874| just a fyi this driver accepted my request then promptly called me and asked "where are you going."  i told him i didnt think he was allowed to call ahead and ask that he asked again. i then told him i was going to cancel the ride.
MSG|875| in the beginning, my driver made a series of wrong turn. i walked to the pick-up location and she was only 1 minute away. she kept making wrong turns and the wait ended up becoming around 8 minute. ive been waiting for about 15 minutes when she accidentally clicked that she already picked me up. she was still about 8 minutes away from me but the app said that she was en route to pick up the next rider. please review the cancellation fee and refund me because my driver was extremely unprofessional and overall, bad.
MSG|876| this driver refused to pick me up and he insulted my uber rating.  he should be terminated for such unprofessional conduct.
MSG|877| my driver did not bother to find me or follow my directions to my pick up spot. very unprofessional.
MSG|878| driver was not driving in the right direction. i was in a hurry had to cancel
MSG|879| dude just straight up didnt move when i requested him
MSG|880| uber did not give me the 5 minutes wait. my driver came way ahead of time
MSG|881| so this was ridiculous i waited 25 min and the. he cancelled. he was rude on phone and no sense of direction. i texted and called and gave him perfect directions and he just cancelled while i waited outside in the heat! so upset
MSG|882| there was no way i was going to be able to walk three blocks in one minute and i had to cancel ride. please refund. this was not a realistic uber match.
MSG|883| i never requested this ride and i never got into this car. i think my account was hacked
MSG|884| fuck uber service
MSG|885| unclear what was charged for this trip
MSG|886| i was waiting for uber driver. and he started my trip when he picked some other rider. i called him twice but he didnt pick my phone. then after 5 mins, i cancelled the ride. the whole process wasted my 30mins.
MSG|887|10am. his arrival time continued to get later and later, and we had a flight to catch. when i attempted to call the driver i did not get an answer. this is unacceptable service when i scheduled a ride almost 24 hours in advance. please do not charge me a cancellation fee.
MSG|888| i was not in the car, trip was started before pickup and driver went around the airport after starting the trip. please refund.
MSG|889| uber2ok10
MSG|890| the driver never arrived to pick me up. someone else took the ride.
MSG|891| i need cancellation fee back
MSG|892| i had  two $5 credits. total $10 that disappeared
MSG|893| will you please verify that i was not charged a $3 cancellation fee? my ride history said i was charged a fee, but the app said i was not when i went to dispute the fee. i waited more than five minutes for a shared uber that was still more than 5 minutes away despite agreeing to a ride that was three minutes away, so id like to verify that i am not charged for the cancellation. thank you very much!
MSG|894| driver was confused and picked up someone else, so i canceled the ride. the driver showed up a minute later and my fare went up and it made me late to work.
MSG|895| someone else took my uber
MSG|896| im upset because i booked this guy who drove away. my fare was supposed to be under $20. when i rebooked its now $30. thats completely unfair. my current fare shouldnt be nearly double because your drivers dont know what they are doing
MSG|897| she missed my street, im on my way to work i dont need a driver missing their gps they should be paying attention
MSG|898| uber is the absolute worst and that is why lyft will forever have a better authority over you guys. my uber was once 1 minute away, i waited for several minutes then it said that the lady was 10 minutes away. the lady only had 4.15 stars, why would you all keep someone like that? i called her about 8 times and was texting her multiple times to ask her to cancel so i wouldnt be charged and she kept declining. i dont want my money to be sent back as credit i would like a refund because i do not plan to use uber ever again and i will be sure to spread the word. you all are truly a disappointment.
MSG|899| i never got in this car, he never picked me up just started the ride without me
MSG|900| my driver called me 3 minutes after i ordered to ask me how many bags i had and where i was going. he never showed up and caused me to wait an extra 10 min. really annoying and rude
MSG|901| i was incorrectly charged for this trip via venmo.  the uber app says i was not charged anything, but i received an email notification from venmo about a charge of $5.74 from uber.  please give me my $5.74 back.
MSG|902| my pinpoint was incorrect
MSG|903| my card has been charged $38.45 the trip was cancelled.
MSG|904| my driver was lost. blamed it on navigation. i called he hung up. very unprofessional. my credit card was charged. he cancelled the trip.
MSG|905| he txted me and asked me to cxl the trip and resched i told him i would be charged two times. i just want my 18.50 refund
MSG|906| the driver called me and was incredibly hostile and rude over the phone demanding to know in advance where i was going and told me to cancel the ride
MSG|907| my driver had a flat tire
MSG|908| ride was initiated in error and immediately cancelled. however, my credit card was charged $19.14. this is the first time i have ever cancelled a trip. please refund.
MSG|909| my driver was very rude and disrespectful i was telling him how to get to my destination cause it only takes 12min to get to my house to the train station and he toke the longest way possible to get me there.
MSG|910| app showed i'm in the car when i never got picked up
MSG|911| car never arrived, driver didnt respond to my texts. i had to cancel and reorder a new car. you should be paying me for my time, if anything.
MSG|912| do not charge me for that cancellation  the driver  did not wait  for me and took off.
MSG|913| driver never picked me up
MSG|914| this driver was taking over the amount of time and it was 11 min why do i still pay 5 dollars when he was so fat away but wasn't moving in the time said . i cancelled cause i was told if you see that it's five mins or more you can cancel it so i did . just spend a lot on uber and 5 $ is 5$
MSG|915| please dont charge me a cancellation fee. the driver was driving away from me on the map for 10 minutes.
MSG|916| my driven didn't pick me up and neither answered my call
MSG|917| i just cancelled very soon because this car would take 7minutes to come which is very long time
MSG|918| my starting eta was 5 minutes. after waiting 4 minutes, it jumped to 7 minutes. the driver was moving in the wrong/opposite direction. id like to think thats a good reason to cancel my ride.
MSG|919| drive called and told me it was too far to drive.  he said if i paid him on the side he would come pick me up.  this is not what i expect with uber.
MSG|920| we couldnt communicate with my driver because my phone died and the trip got cancelled. please refund the charge. thanks.
MSG|921| this uber driver called me to let me know he was in a different car, a kia. ive heard about scams. im sure this was one of them. i cancelled it and i would like my refund asap, please.
MSG|922| my uber driver did not come to my pickup location and i even called him on the phone and he never came or found me. i need to receive a full refund on the $26.60 that was charged to me for no reason! that is a crazy amount to charge someone when the driver did not come to the pickup point and couldnt work it out over the phone.
MSG|923| good afternoon. i am very upset because my driver was going around the place that i supposed to meet. i decide to cancel it because. i was in a hurry. a bus driver drive better than the uber. please i need a full refund of the paymen. i was a customer for a very long time and i have never had an issues. thanks.
MSG|924| refund never took ride
MSG|925| driver was rude, unprofessional and lacked care. he refused service. we asked him to cancel the service if he was refusing to take us to the hospital and he would not do it.  so i had to do it. he was unbelievably rude.
MSG|926| we needed a car for 5 plus luggage from jfk.   driver could not handle it so had to reorder
MSG|927| ride took too long i left on the route while still over 30 minutes to destination. the pool was for $15 i should not be charged $52. this is absurd.
MSG|928| this was a totally unwanted trip. i was trying to schedule for wednesday morning and was also trying to use a voucher.  i tried repeatedly to cancel the pickup but the app indicated i had no upcoming scheduled rides.  i tried cancelling on the website as well. i even deleted and downloaded your app again in an attempt to cancel the ride. i apologize but your app makes it exceedingly difficult to cancel a ride unless you know exactly how to navigate it.
MSG|929| the driver was 10 minutes away from my house nowhere even near the pickup location. she said she picked me up on the app, and said that she arrived. the driver never showed up and it said she already picked me up and she was nowhere near my house never came never answered any of my messages. i need to get my money back and i need a promotion. i am very frustrated
MSG|930| the drive refused to take me to my destination
MSG|931| i have a charge on my bank statements of 10 .10
MSG|932| scammers
MSG|933| i'm sorry, i'm afraid of the car that white people drive because of allergies to dogs.
MSG|934| requested trip to airport. driver had to room for carry on luggage!!!!!!!
MSG|935| my driver never picked me up in fact he started my ride a few blocks from the pick up point. once i saw the black toyota camry pull up to my location and checked the plates he denied that was my ride and the picture matched the driver. i am extremely upset.
MSG|936| i had a different problem but it was not listed my. uber driver didnt drop me off at the right destination
MSG|937| this is a complaint about either the uber app itself or the driver as i am not sure what or who is at fault here. i called an uber and as the driver was about two blocks away from my pickup location, i stepped out into the rain to wait for him. i followed him on my uber app and noticed he took a wrong turn so i waited, but then he continued moving away from my pickup location. at this point, i called him twice and he did not answer. i could find no other way for me to contact him. he did not cancel nor did he pick up my calls which is very upsetting. so finally, after about 10 or so minutes standing out in the rain waiting for him and dealing with this, i had to cancel the ride in order to call for another driver which was a whole different issue as i kept getting very far drivers or canceled on. i was very late to work today and my pay was docked for it! you guys charge customers for canceling to compensate the time and money wasted and yet here you guys are doing exactly that. i count on uber to get me to work, but i will not be using the service if this keeps up. it was a big waste of my time and not to mention money this morning. i, at least, deserve an explanation as to why my driver did not answer my calls nor cancel or the fact that he was at a different pickup location altogether.
MSG|938| this was supposed to be $7. the driver dropped me off and never closed the trip and kept driving. its his first uber and hes an old man.
MSG|939| i take uber to work every morning and this is the first time ive had a driver take 14 mins to pick me up. originally he should of taken 6 mins. i followed him on the map and he was driving away from my location. this made me 30 mins late to work, because i had to cancel then reorder, which meant another 11 mins wait for my nearest uber plus the 25 mins ride to work. this is the worst experience ive had with a driver and uber.
MSG|940| the driver started a ride i never got in
MSG|941| driver put us dangerously close to two cars that pulled over and got out of the car to fight. he driver poorly so he couldnt get around the vehicles and we were right next to the combatants. we left the vehicle to get away.
MSG|942| my driver never moved.....i even tried calling
MSG|943|16for $8.01 and i wasnt even in a uber at that time i need my money back
MSG|944| my driver never arrived in the time promised. he continued to circle the airport then was heading in the opposite direction
MSG|945| i took a trip on the 5/18/19 and i got charged on my card for the trip but it says no charge on my uber account.
MSG|946| i cancel my uber immediately after i called it, and i was charge 35.35 on my account it still the credit  back still haven't posted.
MSG|947| i had an issue with the location settings, i thought i had my home address in to be picked up at, but it was the drop off address, i dont want the driver to not get paid, but if i can have the cancellation fee removed, i dont do this often, and i love your services, but 14$ is too much for a 8$ ride
MSG|948| the driver refused to put suitcases in the car and asked me to cancel the trip
MSG|949| []
MSG|950| uber driver either took someone else or started the ride without me. i was not in this car.
MSG|951| i would like refund of this trip for the accident she caused. it was a huge inconvenience. thank you.
MSG|952| i got out and ordered another car
MSG|953| first it said that my driver would be here in 4 minutes then it went to 11 minutes then 17 minutes then 22 minutes then 28 minutes he didnt answer 1 call from me to him. this is a major inconvenience
MSG|954| the vehicle was too small
MSG|955| i should not be charged any cancellation fee for this ride because it said i was on the trip when the driver never showed up. i waited at the spot but i never saw him and then my phone changed to reflect i was on the trip while i was still standing there waiting.
MSG|956| not moving
MSG|957| my driver ask was im going to newark and never cancel my ride and didnt come pick me up
MSG|958| my driver kept on picking up new people and it took an hour to get to my destination, which typically takes about 15-20 mins! he didnt end my trip after i got off the car after 50 minutes! the charge was supposed to be $5 and now its $14.50
MSG|959| why was i charged 17.83$ on my account?
MSG|960| i would like a refund of my money. he sat where he was located for almost 10 mins when he could of made it to me in 8 mins causing me to be even more late
MSG|961| still got charged even though i cancelled the ride.
MSG|962| he drives extremely slow and i think he just rides for the company. i'm often using this service for work and had to cancel after waiting for 15 min and i had to get a lyft because i knew if i rode with him i would be more late because of his driving pace he needs to understand that riders have places to go and is not in his time or riding for his leisure. i have riden with him before and he drives very very slowly
MSG|963| he said in the system he picked me up and kept going, he never picked me up and i called him and he said i should cancel and order another one so disrespectful
MSG|964| why was i charged $15 ?!
MSG|965| before i took this trip, i had just canceled one moments before and was charged a total of $6.30
MSG|966| your gps did not put me in the right location for pickup. driver went to different location because of ubers own error and driver would not drive to me.
MSG|967| before booking the trip, the uber app said the driver was 2 minutes away. that is why i proceeded to book. but after booking, the first driver cancelled the trip and the estimated time was 8 minutes so i decided to cancel and try again as the wait time was higher than the estimate. however, upon booking again, the wait time was more (12 minutes) and it was too long of a wait given the initial estimate of 2 minutes. hence i had to cancel the trip again. kindly look into the issue and i would be grateful if you can grant me a refund for the cancellation fee. thank you.
MSG|968| i never cancelled the trip
MSG|969| i'm very upset. this driver accepted my ride and then said he couldn't pick me up because he had to pray. this cost me 10 minutes of wasted time plus $10 extra because the ride cost surged due to volume when i rescheduled. please, make this right. not happy
MSG|970| couldnt find driver - and it was raining horrible. lack of communication
MSG|971| they said i was going to far
MSG|972| why must i write a damn email every time i need my damn money back i called this guy 8 times no answer and was moving further away making me late for work !!!!!! this is unprofessional
MSG|973| no
MSG|974| didnt have an animal but there was nothing else to select. he picked up another passenger instead of me
MSG|975| driver refused to come to the pickup location and asked me to walk several blocks in the rain
MSG|976| the driver was an hour away, i canceled the first time then was matched to the same driver again, i do not think it is fair to charge me a fee when i clearly did not want that driver which is why i canceled to begin with
MSG|977| will i be charged only for the cancellation fee and not the whole trip?
MSG|978| please refund my uber trip. i left the vehicle and requested a new vehicle. this can be seen with my next trip with mohomad in his mercury car
MSG|979| i never accepted the trip. i didnt confirm.
MSG|980| the trip was canceled bu uber not by me or the driver
MSG|981| trip cancelled by accident. driver made me exit the car and said there was no way to undo
MSG|982| my trip was supposed to cost $5.89, but i have been charged $15.42. i need a refund for the difference. my driver picked me up, but she was unable to signal on the uber app to start my ride, so while we waited for the app to start the trip, she drove me to my destination. upon arrival, she still couldn't signal a start so she cancelled the ride, which meant i had to cancel since i arrived at my destination already. in order for the driver to get compensated, she called uber support who manually entered compensation for her for the ride based on distance. this then charged me a higher rate which is not the price quoted to me, so i need a refund for the difference. thank you.
MSG|983| 8210
MSG|984| he not pick up me but he accepted my request
MSG|985| i needed to catch a train that was not far from my house. the driver took a wrong turn en route and the pickup time went from five mins to 8 mins, which would have made me miss my train. 8 mins is far too long of a pickup time for a five min ride to begin with, so i canceled. he had not moved any closer to my location
MSG|986| i need the cancelation fee
MSG|987| i was charge with my cancelation. i only cancelled because the driver dis not pick me up and i have to get another ride.
MSG|988| my original price was $36.95 and cancellation fee should only be $5.00 however the remaining $31.95 has not been put back into my account yet.
MSG|989| the uber canceled on me and the app charged me 16 dollars
MSG|990| i believe i was incorrectly charged a cancellation fee on this uber ride. i noticed that he had passed up my street. so i figured that it was just a gps error and that he was going to make his way to my destination. he did not turn around he proceeded to go in the direction he was going. i tried contacting him i called him twice and i also left him two text messages to see if he was going to come pick up me from my destination he did not answer nor reply. i asked if you could cancel the uber ride because i had to be the work for 6am. not only did he not cancel the ride i was charged five dollars for a cancellation fee. it was an inconvenience to me. its also at inconvenience to now be able to contact uber support during times like this. and i was not credited for this canceled ride. hey said i was disputed a $5.75 credit but i had already had that on my account.i need yall to run me my money back please.yall always trying to give a uber credit.i want my money back ,i should be compensated for the inconvenience of my uber ride and having me late for work
MSG|991| my driver never canceled my ride so i had to cancel it after my drop off it should only be the original price
MSG|992| my driver never showed up to my location. i'm disappointed in uber's service.
MSG|993| driver refuse my trip
MSG|994| i canceled my trip before the ride confirmed. it told me my cancellation was confirmed. then five minutes later i looked at my phone and it said my ride was booked. even though i had cancelled it before i had been paired with a driver. i don't know if this was a glitch or what, but i had cancelled it. please refund cancellation fee.
MSG|995| driver wanted me to sit in the front sit but because it was so close to the dash board (there was already a passenger sitting behind it), i was going to sit behind instead. however, he didn't want to move his sit up so i could sit there so i just canceled the ride and took lyft insteaf.
MSG|996| i do not know where this location is at is sending me on an angle i don't think i need to pay for this cancellation fee because i'm not familiar with the streets here and is not giving me the exact address where my uber was found i want my refund or i'm going to list
MSG|997| the lincoln mk whatever that was assigned to pick me up that i waited 7 minutes for drove up and asked if i was going to maryland.  as i was trying to open the door handle to get into the car, the driver into the car, the driver started moving forward and took off down the street.  i ultimately cancelled the car because it was too far away but i find it ridiculous that a driver almost ran over my foot and there isnt a way to address this issue since there was no charge.  your disrespect for public safety is continuing.
MSG|998| although i received a confirmation for this ride it was cancelled by uber and never showed up.
MSG|999| original time was 4 minutes. when i got matched driver was 7 minutes away
MSG|1000| the driver was about to pick me up. he drove by my house and sped up to turn into a neighbors driveway. while doing this, he nearly hit a car in oncoming traffic on a slow suburban road with two kids in it. it was so close. i hate to report drivers because this could be their livelihood. but this was not safe. i am not saying to take away his driving rights, but i do think you need to look into this.
MSG|1001| driver took a lot longer than expected and wanted my time and at the end he did not come to my pick up location. he called me and i did not understand a word he said. i need my refund now
MSG|1002| whenever a driver fails to show or cancels, especially during rush hour, the passenger is forced to re-call a ride, thereby wasting their time, and most likely will be hit with surge pricing. if drivers are compensated when a passenger cancels, why aren't passengers afforded the same courtesy?
MSG|1003| i did not want a driver who was ten minutes away. i canceled and reordered right after- i dont see why there needs to be a cancellation fee.  also i canceled as soon as the driver was booked so he hadnt moved towards me.
MSG|1004| my driver wasnt moving
MSG|1005| hello. my driver picked wrong person and i cancelled. i was still charged 7$ and i want to get it back. thank you
