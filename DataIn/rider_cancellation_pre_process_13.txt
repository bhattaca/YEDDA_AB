MSG|1999| the driver did not have any type of uber identification sticker so i wasnt sure whether he was uber or not but he was on the wrong one way street holding up traffic so when i got in the car i said i just have to wait for my friend and he said im not waiting started to drive off and then let me out down the street from my pick up location . very rude to by the way
MSG|2000| uber marked it as if he picked me up but i never got in an uber
MSG|2001| i feel i shouldnt be charged 5$ fee for this ride cancelled
MSG|2002| hello, i cancelled this ride very soon after ordering.  considering that this driver arrived so soon, and that i am an uber gold customer, please refund the cancellation fee.
MSG|2003|07 and my ride still didnt show up.
MSG|2004| trip took too long. uber was still trying to find me a driver when i cancelled. after booking  trip expected arrival time went up 2 mins so i cancelled as soon as possible.
MSG|2005| this man was incredibly rude and told me to cancel once id already found him. worst experience with an uber driver to date.
MSG|2006| the driver started the trip without me, picked someone else and you guys charged me $7 when it said otherwise. i want a full refund from this trip that i did not took!
MSG|2007| we made our first stop and the driver refused to wait for me, when i attempted to get out the door would not open. i asked to be let out and the driver became aggressive. i told him he was being an asshole and he exited his vehicle with the intent to fight me. i started recording and he pulled out his phone to record in retaliation. he then started narrating the opposite of what occurred. he became violent and threatening. i would like to press charges
MSG|2008| driver stayed in the same spot for 5 minutes and never moved
MSG|2009| cancel this fee!  immediately
MSG|2010| hii i have not yet got my credit for this cancellation the driver didn't pick up and he started the trip i don't know how he did this
MSG|2011|59. since i have to reach office by 9 i couldnt take this cab. the terms of the ride doesnt remain the same when it takes almost triple the amount of time to get to me.
MSG|2012| i changed the destination and the price went from 11$ to 68$ which was unfair, so i had to cancel the trip
MSG|2013| he did not meet at pick up and we i found him he drove very fast
MSG|2014| the driver never showed up to pick me up and started the trip without me even in the car.
MSG|2015| i never got in the car. i my app said i was already on the ride but the uber never showed up
MSG|2016| the pickup time kept getting too long and was unacceptable
MSG|2017|40 pm he said will be here within three minutes the app did send me an alarm saying it will be here in three minutes since he was around the corner he passed my destination kept on driving past cheyenne passed mlk and kept on going forward. i have messaged him multiple times no response back but it does show that he read my message i also tried messaging him in spanish also no response i did take some screenshots to prove that he was not responding to my messages or calls as well due to i did screenshot the destination he kept on pulling away from the pick up address
MSG|2018| why did the uber driver take the fare and she knew she had to pick up her child, now i had to call out from work. that wasnt right that she had to cancel my trip
MSG|2019| uber going the wrong direction.
MSG|2020| the driver never ever came. he literally drove 30min away
MSG|2021| car was talking to long to arrive it said 16 mins then 17 mins, etc. then 25 mins.
MSG|2022| i did not get inside this car
MSG|2023| i never entered the vehicle and had to re-request a ride to my destination. i should be refunded.
MSG|2024| drivers license plate did not match.
MSG|2025| this driver was taking far too long to arrive, which wouldve in turn made me late for work. therefore, i canceled it and called a lyft instead since the lyft drivers were closer. it does not make sense as to why i was charged for a car that was about 10 minutes away from my pickup spot.
MSG|2026| my driver never arrived to pick me up. he kept driving in the opposite direction and didnt even bother to cancel the ride. i called him but he declined the call. i had to wait for another ride and was charged more due to price hike.
MSG|2027| i have 3 cancellations for the same driver. he kept telling me he arrived and started my trip but was not even in my parking lot. i was standing outside. i was texting him in english and he kept responding in spanish which i dont speak. he kept accepting my ride all the times and starting them but never showed up! i was an hour late.
MSG|2028| the driver told all four (4) of us to fit all in the back (only three seats). she had someone in front already, which she is not suppose to. of course we couldnt fit all in the back so i told her to cancelled. but she couldnt do it so i had to do it, which means ill get charged. though this is not my fault. please give back my 6.66 credits. it should be charged on her. i did not know she didnt have enough spots for all 4 when she supposed to.
MSG|2029| he was going other direction, was charged for the trip
MSG|2030| so i canceled by accident and when i requested a ride again the same driver got my request and he text me telling me i might as well cancel again! i told him it was an accident and that he was being rude so he told me to cancel again! so i still dont have a ride home! twice in one week drivers are rude to me! this is the very last time i use uber! i dont have these problems with lyft!
MSG|2031| this ride never picked me up! you can look at the ride before and it shows that he said he had me when he didnt. then it gave me him again and the same thing happened, so i cancelled! the same thing is happening to me tonight. i cant take uber until you fix this bug! please look at all my trips today and youll see what i mean
MSG|2032|45pm on 05/03/19. i waited for my uber driver that accepted my ride, which on the app said the ride was a minute away. apparently the driver decides to go near the 55 freeway and said it was 10 minutes away. already waiting so long, i called my uber driver and she said that she was heading to huntington beach and would only give me a ride if i was heading near huntington beach. that was very inconvenient and unprofessional as i waited for my driver and forced me to cancel the ride.
MSG|2033| driver canceled the trip and said they would take us to grand island
MSG|2034| the driver was very rude and refused to tell me who he was here for.
MSG|2035| i watched my driver pick up and drive off with a different person??
MSG|2036| rude driver
MSG|2037| driver lied to me about having low tire pressure
MSG|2038| i had a small table with me the driver refused to carry saying it wont fit and he didnt even try . i would like you please see in to it.
MSG|2039|(
MSG|2040| driver, kept changing time and never showed up i had to use another driver.
MSG|2041| i requested this trip but my uber accepted my payment when i wasnt in the car and never picked me up, i had to get a whole different ride. i texted him and asked if he was still picking me up but he kept driving the other person in the pool and never answered.
MSG|2042| i am furious. i just waited 40 minutes for my driver. i watched as he inches closer and closer and then he fucking canceled. i am so mad. how dare he and how dare you uber. its midnight and i couldnt be any angrier.
MSG|2043| this was the second uber i ordered in a row. driver passed my destination. started my ride beforei was in the car and took 5 minutes to circle back to my location. i had canceled it before he came back to get me and explained to him that its theft to start the ride before you even pick up the rider. i was never picked up or dropped off so i want my full refund. as you can see i had to order another uber afterwards from the same location to finally get home.
MSG|2044| i was never picked from my location. i kept waiting and the trip on the app showed i was picked up and it has started. whereas i never even saw the vehicle. i had to cancel that trip and book another uber. you may please check the records. thank you
MSG|2045| i was charged the full amount for a my last trip on friday may 10th and was not credited the difference to my bank account.
MSG|2046| he proceeded to cancel my first ride with him without giving me proper notifications or arrival. i had to order another uber which ended up being him again. i confronted him about why he canceled my first ride with out proper notification, did not give me an answer but instead he told me to get out the car. most unprofessional uber experience ever. plus your app says i was not charged for this, however i was charged. so i would like to know what is going on.
MSG|2047| my driver never picked me up even though it said the trip was in progress and when i called the driver to ask where he was going they hung up
MSG|2048| she was extremely rude. she snapped and started swearing at my group. escalated the situation. she was crazy and could have acted more professional.
MSG|2049| my ride was cancelled before one minute even passed and you all took my uber credits
MSG|2050| i never took this ride
MSG|2051| im quite frustrated as this is the second time in recent days that the driver has gone in the opposite direction from the pickup, causing significant delays or canceling the trip and causing me to be late for appointments. simply reversing fees charged in error is insufficient to compensate for time and frustration.
MSG|2052| i was never picked up the driver started the ride and never picked me up i had to cancel the ride and get another car
MSG|2053| i dont want credit. i want refund to my card
MSG|2054| i need assistance fast i'm on vacation and phone is broken
MSG|2055| the driver never showed up and kept driving further away from the pick up location. i also tried to call him but he would not answer so i had to cancel. very disappointed in this situation
MSG|2056| i want my card to be reimbursed.
MSG|2057| so i canceled my u bed like 1 min after ordering bc i had the wrong addres  and they still took about the full amount even tho i didnt ride in the ubber
MSG|2058| no i would just like my full refund.
MSG|2059| he came into the store threatening me and saying he was gonna take all my shit and leave and the cops told him to calm down and when i was going back into the car he was yelling at me and i told him that i would be taking this up to uber and he said so would he if i didnt get in the car so i closed the door canceled my ride and left
MSG|2060| driver repeated declined my phone calls and drove away from the pick up location.  she kept me waiting for over 20 minutes when she was about 2 minutes away when the ride started.  she was exceedingly rude and unprofessional.   please refer to pick up details per your records to confirm.
MSG|2061| there was no vehicle available that's why i cancelled. and i get charged
MSG|2062| i was charged by uber 12.81 for a cancelled trip my account is showing as being debited 12.81. please explain why i have a charge for 12.81 for a ride i didnt even take?
MSG|2063| i wasnt even in the car with the driver, im still sitting here in front of trader joes very confused as to why i didnt get picked up and im being charge for a ride i was not in. this is very ridiculous. i am so tired of this app lol.
MSG|2064| my driver and i was doing two different locations
MSG|2065| i want a refund. uber driver said i cancelled the trip when i did not cancelled. i got out the car because he said i cancelled when i did not. then told me to get back in because he saw that i didnt cancel it so i refused too and cancelled when i got out the car. i want a refund!
MSG|2066| good morning boober first allow me to start with a positive here lately my past few trips have been amazing excellent customer service nice clean cars outstanding conversation now let's move into the negative i booked an uber this morning i saw that the driver was fairly close so instead of texting her i went ahead and called her to help direct her so she wouldn't have any issues she did not receive the direction well in fact she was very rude to me as i was giving her instructions she kept sighing and making comments like oh my lord oh my god i'm a very clear and detailed oriented person and when i'm giving instructions i'm very direct and very very clear she is a very very poor representative for your company i don't know how she earned the rating she did maybe her trips in the past have been very easy but for whatever reason she simply cannot handle this one she was very rude to me and i hope i'm never ever paired with this person again sorry to hit you guys so early in the morning with negative comments but i really wanted to bring this situation to your attention thank you for everything uber i will always be a customer as long as you'll have me
MSG|2067| i canceled this trip and can i have a refund as soon as possible
MSG|2068| my driver said that it would be one minute and then he took a different turn and it changed to 10 minute wait time. i asked him to cancel and he refused. even though he had knowledge that he would be taking him a very long time to get here. he was very rude and it was not a good experience.
MSG|2069| driver was close by then drove away
MSG|2070| said 2 minutes away. 10 minutes later driver still hadnt moved toward me. there was no traffic and i was late already
MSG|2071| no
MSG|2072| i cancelled the ride in less than 1 minute. and the driver was 15 mins away. i shouldnt be charged for a cancellation fee.
MSG|2073| my driver said he picked me up and was already on his way to the city but he never picked me up i have a screen shot of it if you need it.
MSG|2074| the uber took over 45 minutes and kept connecting me to different drivers. once we were connected with an actual driver the minutes kept increasing for a loner wait time and on the map she was driving all over the place. so i texted her and then called her and she didnt respond to either so we canceled it because we didnt want to wait any longer
MSG|2075| did not show pick up point
MSG|2076| i just want a tell you accidentally my nephew click on the uber i am always your good customer but becoz of my 6 yrs nephew i got charged.\nif any way can you give me a credit been a good customer i will appreciate it.
MSG|2077| i had two destinations set, the driver went ballistic and refused to bring me to them, she pulled over and started making a phone call so i had to get out and call a new uber, i demand my money back because this woman left me on the side of the road
MSG|2078| again never picked me up.
MSG|2079| i had a dead line the driver did not move and try to connect and no response
MSG|2080| my driver blew me off without notice. he never came to pickup address. i had my phone light on for him. i tried to call him and no answer. worst service ive ever had from an uber driver
MSG|2081| i ordered the uber for a friend. i watched as my phone as the uber arrived. we went outside and uber driver was not there. i called and sent him a message through the app however he did not answer and read the message but did not respond. i watched on the app as he drove away and i was still charged for the trip because he never cancelled it. luckily i was able to get an uber for my friend within the next 5 minutes but i was charged for two trips and feel very upset. i use uber every time i travel and have never had a driver, drive away while my bank account was being charged.
MSG|2082| i know this street and area well, there were multiple ways of getting to me in less than 5 minutes from where she was.  there was no bad traffic, she was driving all over the place and missing her turns. i was not wasting her time, she was wasting my time. it was as if she was purposely missing all the turns. i was cancelled on before by drivers and they never pay me for wasting my time. so i dont understand why i wasted her time and have to pay her $5. she was missing all of her turns and could have easily gotten to where i was. i want my refund. she wasted my time.
MSG|2083| i never had a confirmed ride and or driver. cancelled before anyone accepted the ride
MSG|2084| driver never arrive. i waited 20 minutes and the ride never showed up. so had to cancel and request a new ride
MSG|2085| driver never picked me up
MSG|2086| my sister and i were late to school and he refused to drive us , he said he had to be 18 and my sister is 18 but she didnt have her id on her , so he resumed our trip just to get our money
MSG|2087| i found that the restaurant at my destination was closed, and had to make different plans. i was ready to pay the original ride rate, as i travelled half way to my destination. but i don't understand why i was charged about double that for an unexpected cancellation. please review and remove either the cancellation charge or the trip charge,and only put one of them on the account. expecting your best. thanks
MSG|2088| i got a full refund for this trip but my credit card is charged for another fee of $29.08. please let me know what this charge since i did not have a trip with this charge. thank you.
MSG|2089| it took my driver to slide the app to pickup status several minutes and he was driving me back to pickup point after picking me up. he also did not end my trip after dropping me off and drove for several minutes away before i ended my trip myself by cancelling the trip. as a result, i was charged more than i was supposed to.
MSG|2090| my estimated time was 5 minutes but after 10 minutes, the time did not change. please refund the cancellation fee accordingly.
MSG|2091| the driver pulled up to location and seen me told me to cross the street i had luggage he then proceeded to go to another destination so i was late very unpleasant
MSG|2092| i am not interested in switching my payment method, but i cannot find an option for the issue i have. i purchased two uber event codes worth $50 and distributed them for use. when we attempted to use these our account was charged an another uber deal was credited. this wasn't as issue because the $50 wasn't charged. i did however pay $5 for each of the event codes and would love to have that figure refunded since it was not able to be applied.
MSG|2093| when i ordered, the system told me it would take me 3 mins to wait the car. but after several minutes, i found the driver went to another direction. when i found he need 25 minutes to pick me up, i canceled the order. i think the driver didnt want to pick me up because he went away further and further.
MSG|2094| no
MSG|2095| the car was more than 5 minutes away, it was going to take him about 10 minutes to get to my location, i shouldnt be charged a cancel fee
MSG|2096| the driver arrived in the picked up point and see me and refused pick me up. i am suspect he discriminated me. refuse picking up without any reason. i dont know he is racist or something else. please take it seriously. i am very pissed off
MSG|2097| i got charged 37 dollars for a cancellation fee. please refund my money. when will it be back in my account?
MSG|2098| me and the driver were trying to change the address because it was put in incorrectly.
MSG|2099| i got in this uber and she dropped me off at my destination. i do not understand why i was charged this amount for my trip
MSG|2100| the driver cancelled this trip - not me. i waited for over 10 minutes and they they cancelled
MSG|2101| he was buying cannabis and made me wait and then tryst to pick me up under the influence
MSG|2102| our driver started our trip and never picked us up. we tried to call him and he answered the phone and never said anything or gave us directions of where he was. it is completely unfair to charge a cancelation fee when drivers are unreceptive to actually wanting to help customers.
MSG|2103| can i get my money back in the same day.
MSG|2104| uber xl should fit (6) people and this drivers car could not.  why should i pay a refund fee for a vehicle thats mislabeled?
MSG|2105| driver refused trip
MSG|2106| driver must have picked someone else up instead of me. i was waiting f for them but they never showed. after they started the trip, i called and could not hear anything on the phone.
MSG|2107| i would like the $5 refunded to my card and not in uber credit please and thanks!
MSG|2108| we tried to change the address of destination and he dropped us off
MSG|2109| my driver did not even pick me up in front of the ritz my pick up location and just started to ride off to drop off the first customer and started the ride without me getting on the car.
MSG|2110| he was rude didnt wanna take me in the ride i would love my money back
MSG|2111| someone ride the car instead of me
MSG|2112| someone else got in our ride
MSG|2113| hi ive been charged for several trips in my bank account today that i had canceled. the only trip i took for the day was my last one with anil.
MSG|2114| my driver cancelled on me.
MSG|2115| the driver canceled on me and i was still charge then i got another uber driver which was the same one that canceled on me again and charge me a cancellation fee what can i do
MSG|2116| money was taken out of my account and i did not take a trip.
MSG|2117| hi the destination address was the address i was already at. so i canceled and resubmitted with the proper address. the driver then received that ride and brought me home
MSG|2118| my driver never picked me up but started my trip and proceed to go like i was in the car.
MSG|2119| i was waiting 20 mins in my location point and after a while  , i look in the app and saw that my uber driver took the next person in the trip (i think megan was her name) i definitely thought he forgot me. i look at the app, and he was very far from me. so i cancelled the trip (which i got charged) without even taken the uber. he didnt not pick me up. i sincerely hope you can check this, i got charged $8 dollars for a trip that supposed to be $3
MSG|2120| this driver did not pick me up and indicated that he did on his app. the app on my phone no longer showed where to go for the pick up and said that the car was on its way to the city even though i wasn't in it.
MSG|2121| i requested an uber pool and i cancelled it the same second and my account was charged 14.29 for the trip
MSG|2122|10. at 8pm i got a notification that the driver was on their was and was 20 minutes away. i then cancelled because that was 10 minutes longer than the window the app showed me. i would like this cancellation charge removed. thank you!
MSG|2123|49am on tuesday 5/21/2019. i cancelled because your driver had a flat tire and wouldnt cancel the trip, thus forcing a $5 cancellation. on the same tuesday 5/21/2019, multiple ubers cancelled on me and uber didnt credit me $5 for those respective cancellations. i request this cancellation fee be refunded to me. if it is not, i will delete the app and use a competitor such as lyft. thank you
MSG|2124| the wait for a driver was to long. please refund this fee
MSG|2125| the driver can't see my address i have to cancel it
MSG|2126| i need my cancellation fee back i re ordered a uber within the 15 minutes so there should be no cancellation fee
MSG|2127| when this uber driver arrived, i asked him who he was here to pick up, as a safety precaution.  he began to argue with me and said, you need to tell me who youre driver is i told him he was was my driver because his car & license plate matched and again asked him, can you please verify who you are to pick up, this driver refused to tell me my name and argued with me in front of the torrance marriott.  i told him i could not get in the car with him if he would not verify my name.  he slammed his trunk, yelled at me and left.  the valet at the torrance marriott promptly called for a taxi and said that i did the right thing by not getting in the car with this driver.  this uber driver is angry and scary and should not be driving for you.  i cant imagine myself or any other woman in a car with him.  im asking that you remove the cancellation fee promptly.  i will not allow one penny of my money going to someone who acted in such an atrocious manner.
MSG|2128| the driver never came to get me but it showed on the app that the ride was in process. i rebooked same trip with another driver.
MSG|2129| i disputed the transaction days ago. i still haven't received my $5fee back on my atm card. it said between 3-5days. and i still haven't received it yet. can u guys help me asap
MSG|2130| my uber driver was very unprofessional when i called him , he used profanity and was telling me that he was moving but waiting 5 minutes after i called he was still in the same spot so he wasnt moving anywhere . it said i had to wait 9 minutes when i ordered a uber and ended up waiting over 30 minutes until i decided to cancel
MSG|2131| he made me feel uncomfortable as i walked to car and went to get gas shortly after picking me up
MSG|2132| i was charged for the trip i canceled how do i get a refund
MSG|2133| dont i get cancellation forgiveness if inbook another trip within 15min since im gold
MSG|2134| this driver showed up and refused to take my family to our destination. we are a family of 4 and each had 1 bag. he told me we needed to order an uber x which is not true because we have been traveling all weekend in uber without any issues with our bags. i asked him to cancel the trip because he was being rude and he said no you cancel it then drove off. he has no business driving anyone around.
MSG|2135| i would like a refund rather than a credit
MSG|2136| driver did not wait
MSG|2137| my pick up was from 10323 s lowe to 11039 s edbrooke i did not take this ride
MSG|2138| i ordered uber. driver refused to come pick me up.
MSG|2139| the driver kept going around but didnt come to my pickup even after i had called him and told him which way to go
MSG|2140| time for pickup was excessive and increased!
MSG|2141| the address listed as my destination is not mine at all. when i called the driver because it was over 10 minutes since it showed he was close by he stated he had already picked me up. clearly, he picked up another driver that was not me. after 15 minutes of standing i finally cancelled
MSG|2142| the driver kept moving away from me even though he had multiple opportunities to turn towards me
MSG|2143| refund
MSG|2144| yuri nevered picked me up or answered my calls. i've texted him many times and he never answered. i've documented everything. im late getting to my appointment
MSG|2145| i waited for more than what the time displayed on the app
MSG|2146| the driver charge my an additional fee for the ride. i also had to pay for her gas. i want the cancellation fee returned.
MSG|2147| i was incorrectly charged for a cancellation fee when the driver state that they picked me up but really didnt i was still in my pick up location.
MSG|2148|19 and he accepted a ride when he was 13 minutes away. the moment he accepted the ride he didnt move an inch, i waited and i watched. ridiculous that you guys even charge anything for that, the guy accepted the trio from across the world.
MSG|2149| my driver called me as soon as he picked up my request  and had asked me very rudely where my exact location was even though i pinned my location and share my live location with the driver and as i was trying to give him description he cuts me off and is asking me if i was in front of the building and as im trying to say and tell him exacting where im was  he keeps cutting me off and speaking to me as if im a child , i felt as if i couldnt get a word so instead being apart of a phone call that felt like an argument with a stranger i hang up and cancel the ride and try and request another ride and he picks up me request again  at this point i start to feel unsafe like why is he so angry and still wanting me in his car
MSG|2150| the driver kept wandering at the highway and didn't move inside the colony, even after i sent texts and made calls. he kept disconnecting the call. i would have directed him if he received
MSG|2151| no
MSG|2152| yes
MSG|2153| drive took twice as long as estimated time to arrive. had to cancel and request another uber.
MSG|2154| i do not care about getting refunded. i just wanted to let you know that the pick up location i was supposed to be at has no pedestrian access. it is a busy intersection with no crosswalks or sidewalks. if i were even able to dodge traffic to reach that point, i would have been waiting on a patch of grass for the car to pick me up. this location needs to be reviewed by uber as a pick up point.
MSG|2155| im trying to book a cab to the airport for s flight leaving in 5 hrs., but your app doesnt have an option to book with baby car seat, can some care to revert?
MSG|2156| i did not select uber pool.
MSG|2157| my drivers vehicle stopped. she called to confirm and told me to cancel ride. i wanted to know if i could redeem my verizon special discount since i used it up on uber ride with sherry. let me know.
MSG|2158| freeway was blocked off i got charged way more then i expected!
MSG|2159| yes
MSG|2160| i waited for 25 minutes and was never picked up. i should be refunded and given a credit for the time wasted. i was never picked up.
MSG|2161| he picked up someone that is not me ..... i was waiting outside and i didnt see him and it shows he picked up and he didnt
MSG|2162| im wondering why i was charged 250 for a trip i canceled
MSG|2163| okay this happened twice today with a problem with uber.. i waited for my uber to arrive at the destination and he just accepted my ride and never picked me up! there was no way of calling. so i had to cancel ! and requested another ride as it shows i did. i keep losing money with uber and i would need a refund back!! you can reach me at karenesthergarcia98@icloud.com
MSG|2164| what the fuck was that? this shit ass uber wasted 20 mins of my morning this motherfucker could ve cance my shit ass ride im fucking using lyft after today fuck yall l
MSG|2165| driver wasnt paying attention to where he was going back into another vehicle that was behind him
