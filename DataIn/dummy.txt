MSG|1| there was an error with 2 rides then both got cancelled, your driver told me i have to get out. he left me stranded in a dark place, i didn't know where i was left. it was a dangerous area felt scared and unsafe. i told him it's unsafe, he's respond was i don't care you have to get out. i had two rides show on my phone but he was the 1st one there so i cancelled the 2nd ride but made a mistake on picking the right ride..then your driver had another pickup which was cancelled too. i just felt i was dropped off to an unsafe area and i didn't know.
MSG|2| i had the most important meeting of my life today. ive ordered ubers plenty of times and knew that this would be most reliable source of transportation for such an important morning. once the app notified jeffrey was here, i looked around and saw no cars. i walked up and down the street, i called two times and both calls were cancelled. i even texted him, but nothing. finally, i recognize his car by his license plate, since he had no sticker or no identification of him being an uber driver, i approached the car and ask if he was jeffrey my uber driver. to my face he denies being my uber driver, i then show him the information on the app that matches the car and show him the picture that matches him, and he continues to deny this is him. at this point i am already running late because jeffrey accepted my ride  but never made any effort to actually take me my to my destination. not only was he parked the entire time( i have pictures) but he failed to even have any uber stickers or gear which would allow me to easily identify him. i had to order another uber, but my morning has already been ruined. i am now running late and to make matters worse, i was charged a cancellation fee for the most unprofessionals service that i have ever received in my entire life. i wish people like this could receive a rating for being completely unprofessional. if i could, i would easily rate him negative stars because even giving a one would be too generous. i feel humiliated and completely appalled by the behavior of this man. these are the kind of experiences that push people to utilize other services such as lyft instead of uber.
MSG|3| i had scheduled a uberxl for additional room for my luggage. the car never came at my scheduled time. i had to call a uberx economy which was the only car available. now im late 30 minutes late to the airport and the car is too small for all my belonging
MSG|4| i rode with him prior and tried to change destination when we were enrout to my original destination but it created another trip which i cancelled while in vehicle with him
MSG|5| address was incorrect i tried to change it while the ride coming but couldnt so i had to cancel
MSG|6| driver came then wouldnt pick us up due to too many bags with us.
MSG|7| please ensure that i am not charged for this cancellation fee. your drivers should not pick up fares before they have finished their last ride as it wastes your customers time. you should not charge cancellation fees to customers because you have wasted their time with poor policies.
MSG|8| i was not charged, and i thank you, but there should be a way that you make the drivers have their cars in working and running condition. my daughter and i, we where more than a 1/2 hour late and this driver did not contact me. i reached out to him then after a few text he told me he had to check on the coolant in his car. the drivers must make sure cars are in working order to drive. because of his negligence my daughter was sad and i was upset and ruined our trip out. the next driver was on it and very professional.  not this driver.
MSG|9| i was originally requested to be picked up in four minutes. after over 10 minutes the car drove by where my pick up point was and then dropped me. i was then switch to another driver which was 10 minutes away. after 30 minutes of waiting between two different drivers i cancel. please remove any cancellation fee i will not be using the service moving forward. thank you
MSG|10| driver cancelled. no one else was available. i have a charge on my credit card!
MSG|11| the driver never showed up to my pick up location and started the trip when he never showed up. i tried contacting him through txt and calls but he never responded so i canceled the trip but i am still getting charged for it.
MSG|12| yes
MSG|13| driver refused to take me to my destinatoln
MSG|14| very unprofessional, rode past me stopped at gas station across from me and the went in a whole other direction!  then when i tried to contact him he said his car broke down! but was still traveling. a simple phone call instead of having me wait!  very very unprofessional.
MSG|15| driver was 10 minutes away, which was too long of a wait. please refund.
MSG|16| driver went to a different location. when i called him, he started shouting rudely in a foreign language. i should be fully refunded and not charged additional fare for next driver. this driver should be banned from driving for uber.
MSG|17| can i please have my credit from the cancellation fee refunded to the credit card it was charged to? necessary due to business purposes.
MSG|18| smelled bad
MSG|19| he picked up someone else so i had to order another uber
MSG|20| i cancelled my ride because my driver drove past my pick up spot and continued to keep driving away. i requested a new ride.
MSG|21| i was stranded at my location and the driver never arrived
MSG|22| my driver told me he was in 20 minutes of traffic even though there was no traffic. he clearly didnt want to drive me because he was in a suburban and i didnt pay for a black car.
MSG|23| i had ordered the uber as i was exiting my residence. i live in an apartment and my building was a little bit away from the front gate. as i was coming down the stairs out of my building i get a phone call from the driver yelling at me asking where i am. i try to tell him what's going on but he just continues to yell at me which in turn i tell him to cancel the ride then. i waited for him to cancel it but he was refusing, i needed to get to work so i in turn cancelled the ride. he was so unprofessional and inconsiderate of the circumstances. i should not be the one paying for his actions. help me out here. thank you
MSG|24| the driver told meit would be a 20 minute wait that turned into an hour. he also started the trip but never picked me up.
MSG|25| your app wasted my time looking for a driver when none. changing to lift now, uber is so big it bleeds profits through incompetence. i am a business consultant who can save your asses.
MSG|26| what ask a question was offer a pass for 24.99 try to accept it but was ask to use another card why when  i have funds on that card
MSG|27| my driver did not pick me up but passed me and continued going in the opposite direction of my pickup, towards my destination. i tried calling but he didnt answer so i had to cancel and request another ride because i was waiting outside on the rain for too long
MSG|28| the driver of the ford was there and he cancelled his self and helped me. but yall sent another driver and i had to cancel him cuz the ford driver was still helping me.
MSG|29| driver got pulled over by a cop!! had to be somewhere so had to jump out to get subway
MSG|30| after we got on the car and he said he is too tired to drive and asked us to get off the car. he is very very unprofessional. refusing destination just because hes tired? ridiculous. i want to get a refund for this not happened trip.
MSG|31| while we were on the way the driver had a flat tire so i had to call another uber about 4 mins into the trip and got charged 95% of the trip.
MSG|32| i was charged and i still dont see a refund and i need the money to get back home cause it drained my card
MSG|33| the location was wrong i was new to uber need a ride at 630 am may 25 to ohare. i did not realize that the location said the street over. so i corrected this by adding my home address .   once again please pardon the mistake as i will much need this service this morning , i dont want to go into a panic.
MSG|34| i was trying for 30 minutes to get an uber but the app wouldn't show a ride. i closed out the app and then it selected a driver after i made either plans. please refund my cancellation fee.

MSG|51| driver kept on driving around the block and would not come to the pick-up point. so i cancelled my trip and was charged $5.00.
MSG|52| hello, my driver was not following the uber maps directions to my destination. instead he went out of the way to my direction which made me feel very unsafe so i canceled my trip.
MSG|53| the driver never picked me up and started the ride many blocks away from my location. i need a refund immediately.
MSG|54| it took money after canceling
MSG|55| no
MSG|56| while waiting for my uber pool his evening i had two drivers cancel on me for some reason.  i was then connected with a driver that was 13 minutes away. after cancelling due to the absurd total wait time, i waited 5 more minutes to be connected to another driver. ultimately, i waited 20+ minutes just to be picked up from a college in san francisco. why did this happen?
MSG|57| waiting time was 7 min. after waiting for more than that, waiting time jumped to 12 min. so 19 min total. driver took a complete different route
MSG|58| my driver wouldn't come to my pick up address and argued that he was here. when he never came.
MSG|59| yall took 9.06$ out my account and i didnt get the ride
MSG|60| my uber refuse to pick up me, i called 4 times and text him but he never answered and he went to other way
MSG|61| my driver drove completely past me without stopping or slowing down and kept on going
MSG|62| he not move. he said i have arrived
MSG|63| before i approached his car i asked him what was the name of the person he was picking up. he said what? i said who are you picking up? he said whats your name? i asked him again to please tell me who he was picking up. he said you. so since he could not say my name, i was afraid to get in the car. he was very rude with an attitude as well.
MSG|64| driver did not come to my pickup and then proceeded to call me and curse me out using the f word
MSG|65| driver did not move
MSG|66| i think that you dont care or dont take my customer feedback seriously cause trust me i m going to start burning some of those ubers cars to the ground so that some other people can follow it, you cant just charge me on some bullshit and walk away while you fucked up my entire hussle , if you fuck with me i will fuck with you too. i maybe tne first guy who is going to start some crazy rebellious shit on those cars since i have been scammed for some stupid ass shit. i aint playing on this
MSG|67| my driver and i couldn't connect plus i got charged wrongly on my account, i got to be somewhere
MSG|68| the car either never showed up or someone else got in. there were multiple gray toyota camrys that showed up within a minute or so but none i saw had the right license plate. i dont know who took this ride but it wasnt me.
MSG|69| i was charged $13.67 and $13.47 for same ride and was quoted a different rate please return my refund did not authorize to charge my account so many times
MSG|70| i have matched with this driver before and requested to never be matched with him again. on a different uber account now all i am asking is not to be matched with him because he is a rude driver.
MSG|71| the driver was pulled over for not wearing his seat belt.
MSG|72| she did not drop me off where i requested
MSG|73| the driver was too far away
MSG|74| no wav rides available (first was canceled by driver) for almost 1.5hr! missed appointment, requesting $5 credit card refund instead of uber cash.
MSG|75| uber got a flat tire and had to stop on the side of the road
MSG|76| something was wrong with the app! it was shown that i am already in the car while i was not.. the app didnt update, i had to cancel the ride
MSG|77| driver left me by the highway where there was no place to get any other transportation ,he argue with me because i ask him to go a different route that thegps was sending him
MSG|78| i was trying to tell steven on my last ride that i had trouble using my friends card because she was going to pay for my uber to my home. she has used her card on previous trips for me. however, it overdrew my account because her card wouldn't be accepted by uber. i told steven that it charged my account instead of my friends. i am permanently disabled and on a fixed income. i would greatly appreciate if you can remedy this issue for me. it was the drivers negligence to hang up on me while we were trying to explain that the cancellation fee came out of my account instead of my friends. now i am stuck and have a lot to do tomorrow. please remedy this or i will move on to lyft.. also, i would appreciate your drivers to not hang up on me and fill them in on information that we are not aware of. yes.. i did record the conversation. thank you. 
MSG|79| the driver never came
MSG|80| i have had this driver before and thought i rated him low enough so he wouldnt pick me up again. when i saw him take my request i immediately canceled. i waited and tried again, he took my request again, i canceled. he did that five times until i finally changed to uberx. when i went out to take that uber this driver was waiting in front of my building yelling at me and i quickly hop in the other car and left. please mark this driver so he never picks me up again
MSG|81| i didn't get the car can you refund my cancellation fee refunded thx
MSG|82| i was charged four times the same acount of money for a trip that i didnt take. i want my money back because this trip was never taken

MSG|84| i was not able to get to the pickup area quickly enough. it was too far
MSG|85| couldnt find the car
MSG|86| it was a 4 stop ride starting at my friends house for her birthday and we spoke and he agreed to wait a few minutes for her to get ready and i told her to speak with him as well so he can see her face and then then i saw the ride was in  progress...and i said let me call my friend to see if it was her and she said no! so i cancelled the ride!
MSG|87| my car never came
MSG|88| the driver never came to the location i had selected and i was never picked up. no call, no text. i texted them and said i hadnt been picked up and there was no response.
MSG|89| i wasnt correctly charged a cancellation fee. i was still charged for the actual ride even though i never got in the uber.
MSG|90| driver never showed up and was not moving
MSG|91| i never got in the car but the app said i was already on my way home. i want a refund.
MSG|92|45 the frosty driver was a no show. the second driver called to confirm my location and then cancelled. the third driver was a minute away and never showed up, i waited 5 minutes and he continued to drive further away! this had been very frustrating! i should not be charged a cancellation fee, if anything i should be refunded for the half hour i wasted trying to get a ride!
MSG|93| i cancelled with this driver three times late last night / early this morning because he wasnt driving towards me. the app finally matched me with another driver on the third or fourth try, and i took that uber different car home. you have refunded the other cancellations; please refund this one. thank you.
MSG|94| i couldnt find the driver please reimburse me thanks
MSG|95| the driver did not pick me up. i shouldnt be charging a cancellation fee.
MSG|96| drivers app was not functioning properly. it would not start the trip as he drove in circles trying to confirm the trip. he tried restarting the app and his phone but that app still did not work. he had us cancel the ride trying to see if it would work  but it did not so we had to call another uber. i should not be charged the cancellation fee when it was uber apps fault.
MSG|97| the driver never picked me up, although the said he did. now my new request is $3 more.
MSG|98| my driver called and would not come pick me up at my location. he wanted me to walk to another location to meet him.
MSG|99| cancelled right away,still got charged. can you refund me the cancellation fee
MSG|100| driver accepted my request and continued to move away from airport. i asked and said he was getting gas. his vehicle continued to move away for another 10 minutes. showed another uber and they said he was lying.  very unprofessional and i used to use uber often. not any more. plus will tell about the bad experience in this somewhat small community.
MSG|101| no
MSG|102| the driver never picked me up. i texted and called but didnt receive a response
MSG|103| requested comfort
MSG|104| this driver never picked me up. someone else must have taken this trip. this driver called me from a location that i did not request a pickup from, but even after that never showed up. \n\ni waited a long time for his arrival
MSG|105| when i got in the car my driver said he did not want to drive to brooklyn. he refused to cancel the ride because he wanted the cancellation fee.
MSG|106| my driver did not speak english very well, so when he asked me to go to 84th street and not my designated location at 85th street and 1st ave i happily obliged. he was not there, and we went back and forth talking about 84th street until i finally had to give up because he was so confused. i am now late to my appointment and was charged a cancellation fee, that i would like to be reimbursed for. thank you.
MSG|107| hello you all charged me three times $11.24 one was cancelled but to other are still there. i never took the car nowhere never came and it was cancelled trip twice. so i need my money back in my account asap as fast as you took it o want it back i dont care if its in ride credit or in my account but i want it back. you can see those 3 crazy charges back to back and you will see i never got in no car
MSG|108| waited 10 minutes for her to arrive and she was across the street from me. therefore, i message her saying that and she went to the other intersection street and u turn and just vanish while i got the notification stating we were picking another person up. \ni contacted her because it stated that i was with her in the car when i wasnt. \nshe didnt bother to reply back to my messages and i even called her too. \ni needed to get another transportation method (lyft)\nvery unprofessional of her. \nshe didnt even give me 2 minutes to walk to her. \ni am truly disappointed.
MSG|109| my driver would not answer my calls or my texts and drove right by me while both myself and a valet gentleman tried to wave him down. utterly ridiculous. very frustrated.
MSG|110| i had to cancel as we seemed unable to get to our destination due to the 2019 five boro bike tour. i was charged $3.60 for this trip and then was charged $18.45 after canceling. would really appreciate a refund of $18.45, as this was out of our control. thank you.
MSG|111| the driver accepted before he meet me. ive never saw the car. he accepted, and go for a ride, without me! this is why i canceled
MSG|112| it was pitch black at night my uber was taking to long i called the driver and he answer and said cancel because he didnt want to pick up a bitch
MSG|113| i actually cancelled this on accident because the app wasnt working. i need my fare adjusted to the original amount. the driver took me to my destination and dropped me off. i need the rest refunded to my card.
MSG|114| i canceled within the first 2 mins and i realized i put the wrong pick up destination.
MSG|115| he never show up ..
MSG|116| this driver never came into may location.. this is my second  he's name it's always show up here .. this is a  fucking scam !!!
MSG|117| she seemed under the influence. had erratic and frenetic behavior but was not looking at traffic. we needed to get out at 5th and s highland because she pulled out on 5 th ave. without looking and almost killed us as 2 cars were coming the other way. she needs
MSG|118| the driver activated my ride but never picked me up.    i called him twice and finally he realized he was almost to my destination but had never picked me up.    hes cancelled the ride and left me back at my destination for 25 minutes.  i should not be charged!
MSG|119| my driver started my ride and never picked me up. this is incredibly frustrating and got charged for a ride that never picked me up.
MSG|120| hi i ordered a uber share for a trip but the driver didnt head my way at all even though he was few blocks away.he ended up going towards my destination without me.i was charged for waiting?
MSG|121| i cancelled the trip immediately when i realized the driver was over 6 minutes away. i should not be charged a cancellation fee because i cancelled within 2 minutes.
MSG|122| bro im looking to go home he was moving away from me imma need you to remove charge because you are not about to be driving away on my dime no ma'am.
MSG|123| i was on biscayne and 186th.
MSG|124| my uber driver never came and picked me up
MSG|125| i ordered this uber hoping not to run late. i received a 7 minute wait time. as i proceeded to finish up putting on my mascara and eyeliner i looked at my phone again to see zero movement from the driver. it still stood at 7 minutes showing the car twisting and turning. i canceled this fair due to no movement. it is really unfair to charge me this cancellation. clearly you people need to get your business in order.
MSG|126| the driver called and said he had a customer in his car and that he would be 10 mins.. im not paying this fee
MSG|127| can u please release my money
MSG|128| i received the drivers information as the system indicated, but the car type and plate did not match. i tried to locate the car showed on the app and it turned out to be another car. i canceled the trip, and made two more new requests and it was still the same driver with the wrong car type. please refund my cancelation fee and perhaps investigate?
MSG|129| i do not agree with these fees. when i ordered the trip all of a sudden my app did not show me anything else than i had to re enter my phone number with a text message code etc... meanwhile i was blind on the driver , trip, waiting time etc... so as i was in a hurry i took a yellow cab, and inside i started to insert my phone number. that is where i found out that a driver had taken my order and was waiting for me. not fair at all as i dont understand why my number was asked again, and why meanwhile it blocks the app!!
MSG|130| i ordered an uber and he never came. the expected wait time rose more and more until i had to call him (emmanuel). he told me that he was in a different city (brockton- the city i was supposed to be dropped off in). he, then, told me to cancel the ride because he was unable to cancel the ride from his end.
MSG|131| n/a
MSG|132| hi i ordered a round trip but after 2 min i understood that it is no needed  so the driver drop me after riding only 3 streets i understand that i need to pay cancellation fee but why in a same price of a round trip i drove only 3 street and he even didn't take me back to the original location please review the ride and i hope you will reduce the cancellation fee i drove 3 street and was charged 26 dollars
MSG|133| my driver picked up someone else and never answered my calls. left me for 15 minutes.
MSG|134| the driver damon said he picked me up and started my trip which is incorrect because im still standing at the airport. the driver just drove away
MSG|135| service animal was denied and driver rudely drove away
MSG|136| uber has really become a serious problem in chicago. nearly every time i try to get an uber for the airport on monday mornings (i do so every week) there is some sort of cancellation. but this week took it to new levels. i was assigned to jabal (license plate bg22624) who called me as soon as we were matched. he asked me to confirm my pickup address and asked where i was going. i said i was going to ohare and asked if that was a problem. he said no, and started heading towards me but was 8 minutes away. when he got close to my house, he proceeded to keep on driving past my place. after attempting to call him many times, i messaged him asking him to please cancel because i needed to get to the airport. he never responded and forced me to cancel. the most frustrating part was his dishonesty and the fact that he caused me to have to call a new lyft because it was also 8 minutes away. this caused me to almost miss my flight. my lyft driver was explaining that this is a very common problem in chicago on monday mornings. i know uber already refunded the cancellation, but this is beyond the $5. this driver should be punished for his schemey driving, what he did should not be acceptable. that could have cost me $350 if i missed my flight and arrived late to work. please make things better and restore my faith in uber.
MSG|137| my driver said he picked me up when he hadnt.
MSG|138| drunk and driving
MSG|139| the driver was under the influence and i could smell the liquor. me and other passenger was both complaining to driver he ignored us and proceeded to drive the same. he was eating tic tacs to get rid of the smell. the driver almost had 2 accidents with semi trucks because he was in the turning lane trying to proceed straight. i was scary the whole trip. uber you guys have to do better with choosing your drivers this is a continuous issue with this company and i continue to support you guys still this is ridiculous. i thank god i made it home safe to my children.
MSG|140| she was 10 minutes away and was taking to long u shouldn't have to pay because she was to far
MSG|141| dropped myself and another mid 20s female off in the middle of an intersection at 2am without question. even after i asked what he could do to help us.
MSG|142| i didnt cancel a trip. and got kicked out of the car. in the middle of brooklyn. at 2 am. despite my attempt at having a discussion with my driver regarding my safety.
MSG|143| i was picked up only to be driven to the wawa close to the point of origin, about half a mile away, where we went to fill up gas and it took him about 10 minutes between paying and pumping gas. i then realized i was behind schedule. at this point i cancelled the trip. please revise my cancellation fee as i was not responsible for the drivers lack of professionalism. thanks
MSG|144| the drivers trunk was full and refuse to move it to fit my luggage than refuse my trip.
MSG|145| hello. there are two charges ($5 from 5/3 and $5.28 5/2) on my corporate account that we're refunded as uber credits instead of being refunded on my credit card. please revise and refund the corporate card. one of these was due to your driver not being in the indicated location and other was due to the driver not driving towards my location. please reach out with questions to 347-604-0874
MSG|146| my driver drove very fast and never stopped the ride after he dropped me off so it over charged my card
MSG|147| i did not book this trip why am i being charged
MSG|148| someone else got in my car and left.
MSG|149| he never came and went to pick up someone else while having it as if he picked me up , thats why i canceled in the middle of the ride
MSG|150| i didnt even take this trip.
MSG|151| driver picked up wrong passenger. i shouldnt be charged.
MSG|152| driver never showed, did not respond to attempt to communicate, and then i see in the app he put me in route! i was never in the car! i cancelled and it looks like you charged me for a partial trip? total fraud. he never showed up to pick me up.
MSG|153| i canceled the first time because i did not want the service, and the second time i did not want to walk.  i can not be charged for a service i did not use, and the driver did not have to drive.  i'm really tired of uber, every day is the same problem.  i want my money back

MSG|155| i called and wait but the uber driver never move so i canceled and then call again in 1mins but still same driver so canceled again and call again too  but uber charge me $5
