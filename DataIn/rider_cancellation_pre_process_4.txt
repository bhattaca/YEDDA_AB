MSG|508| i was charged twice for one fare. 31.17 and 31.18
MSG|509| the driver never came to my pick up point, but put in that she did and drove away to my set destination
MSG|510| i want to report this driver because he just wasted my time and now im late for a meeting this guy called me as soon as he accepted the ride and said that he only takes people to ny and that i have to cancel and request someone else i said for him to cancel he said no you cancel and left me waiting there what kind of drivers do you guys hire this guy doesnt want to work he is choosing and picking the rides that he wants to take not professional at all bad experience
MSG|511| canceled trip but still charged on card although says canceled
MSG|512| the driver called and said that he picked up the wrong person and to cancel
MSG|513| hello,  i was charged for a ride that i didn't even take place and i would like a full refund. i had requested an uber to get me into cheney wa and had about at 15 minute expected wait time. while i was checking the time of arrival it changed to in route while i was still sitting where i originally was. i looked outside for an uber, saw nobody and it said it was still in route. i cancelled the trip because i wasn't even in the vehicle and got charged 8.16$. please refund this amount. \nthanks\ndillon
MSG|514| the vehicle was very smelly. please make sure i do not match with this driver again, several of us will not take uber from greenwich ct back to nyc because of him.
MSG|515| my son and i stood out in the cold for close to 10 minutes waiting for the driver. the app showed him essentially going in circles most of the time. it was already past the 2 minutes for cancelling, it was late and cold and we had no idea whether he would ever arrive. we were on a main road and should have been easy to find. how is it fair to get charged a cancellation fee under those circumstances? please refund the $5. thank you.
MSG|516| never got in the car
MSG|517| driver didnt move for over an hour and he was just 10 min from me, after over an hour he text me if i can cancel because hes off i told driver to go ahead and cancel service he said he couldnt cancel that i have to cancel and i wont be charged i took screenshots of the conversation and how long he took and his location, he made me wait now 2 hours, i dont feel i should be charge for this, if you need proof i took screenshots thank you if you have any questions you can text or call 657-246-5578 or you can email me juanjrduarte@yahoo.com thank you
MSG|518| the pickup spot was outside the designated area. it was another avenue over than where it should have been. i cancelled and requested a new pool and the pickup spot was within the designated area. the first location was way outside. the 2nd pickup was on the wrong side of the street going the wrong way on a one-way so obviously there is an issues with the system
MSG|519| i was still charged $7.20 for this uber trip when i never got into the car with this person
MSG|520| i never took this trip! please refund this back to my card
MSG|521| my driver was really far away and i cancelled it the moment i was connected to that driver.
MSG|522| my driver never picked me up. i was at the spot to meet. i called him and messaged him multiple times. he did not answer. i screenshotted the conversation. he then started the trip without picking me up so i cancelled. this is the second time this has happened to me today
MSG|523| uber car seemed to take someone else.  i called another uber to take me home
MSG|524| how are you going to charge me for canceling a ride i didnt ask for the same driver twice thats why i canceled
MSG|525| driver never came , i been waiting
MSG|526| i have a fee pending
MSG|527| i was charged for my trip i canceled but my driver got 2 minutes away then was headed away from me, i was almost late for work but thankfully i canceled and got a new driver who got to me promptly and to work on time.
MSG|528| the app said the driver was 1 min away, then he looked around without stopping & it went to 6 min then he drove away & it went to 11 min
MSG|529| i tried to cancel before the allotted time but the app would not let me
MSG|530| driver went in opposite direction. had issue with mobile phone running out unable to charge. dropped us off near allianz field stadium, told us to cancel ride and get another uber. in rush hour.
MSG|531| i remember it. i do not like spending too much in travel
MSG|532| i was charged for this fare and a cancellation fee. i have proof on my bank statement. and would like a full refund thank you.
MSG|533| someone else took this. i never even got in the car.
MSG|534| my driver did not pick me up. i called and  it was going to voice mail.
MSG|535| i was not informed of a cancellation fee at the time.  are you seriously  tricking people??? i'm so glad i reviewed  my trips otherwise i wouldn't have known i was charged!!
MSG|536| he called me to ask where i was going and then didnt move from his location for 5 mins
MSG|537| driver never pick me up
MSG|538| hi. i contacted driver twice through your app for your review and he didnt move. i stayed in the same area for way longer than his eta. and he still didnt come. i should not be charged anything since this was his fault.
MSG|539| driver did not show
MSG|540| he only took me one way. so i shouldnt have to pay for the whole amount.
MSG|541| the drivers arrival time kept on getting pushed back so i canceled it to order a different ride because i was in a hurry.
MSG|542| hi,\n\ni requested a uber, and i wasn't even in the ride yet. the driver accepted the ride without me being in the vehicle, and you guys took the money off my account. i canceled the ride because she wasn't planning on canceling the ride, and take off with my money without her even bringing me to my destination....may i have my full reimbursement back please?\n\nkia
MSG|543| unknown. she texted me upon arrival that she had a sky blue car. i never approached the vechicle, since it wasnt the one uber told me to expect.
MSG|544| yes why am i getting charged he didnt even pick me up he left and then didnt answer my text or phone calls
MSG|545| some one hit my drive
MSG|546| driver arrived as i was coming down on my elevator  when i got to him he saw that i had my 90 year  old mother in a wheelchair. when my son told him he had too much stuff in the trunk he tried to take the whole wheelchair apart .i  would not let him do that and he proceeded to tell me i was still going to be charged and that i needed a larger vehicle. he left and i  called another service which was the same type of vehicle a camry and had no problems getting the wheechair in the trunk without having to take it apart. why should i be charged for a drver who could not accommodate his customer.
MSG|547| my driver drove off before i was in the car. my door was still adjar. he refused to push the back of his seat up.
MSG|548| my driver did not wait until i was fully in the car before he drove off. my door and leg were still getting in the car.
MSG|549| it was longer than 20 minutes and driver never arrived to pickup location.
MSG|550| my driver seems to have picked up a different rider before showing up to pick me up. i should have no cancellation fee, as the ride never happened.
MSG|551| driver said he was at a different location and told me to cancel the trip. he also said he would not pick up or contest the matter.
MSG|552| driver drove past me and i waved and he kept driving the opposite direction.
MSG|553| never showee
MSG|554| the driver hit the start ride button but never picked me up. when i called him he didnt know what to do. so i cancelled the trip and then ordered a new uber and got the exact same driver. please refund my cancellation fee
MSG|555| i am being charged 4 separate times on a ride that i ended up canceling because application wasnt working properly
MSG|556| i am being charged for this ride on my debit i need not to have the money pending if it says 0.00 on my recent trips why am i being charged my driver is taking way longer than expected.
MSG|557| driver was rude.
MSG|558| the driver was extremely rude and irate. this man arrived with an attitude. he yelled in a sober womans face yelling, only two in the back as three women were comfortably seated. he then begun speaking vulgar slurs and sexist, derogatory, racists remarks out of no where after he was calmly told to be respectful and calm down as none of us were neither drunk nor belligerent. he then proceeded to say, get the fuck out my car. slammed open the doors and pushed the woman who ordered the uber in her back. this was the absolute worst experience ive ever had. i will be canceling my uber account and sueing as this interaction was documented and recorded.
MSG|559| driver was taking to long plus i just requested a new driver and its still him... so u guys needa give me my 5 dollars back
MSG|560| dude took off without me. left me at my first stop
MSG|561| my driver started the trip immediately upon answering the trip request. i was not in the car.
MSG|562| i was trying to book an uber but before i got picked up the app started saying the trip was in progress but it was not. i was on the sidewalk.  then the driver messaged me and said i should cancel because the app was acting weird. so then i canceled and booked another
MSG|563| driver was 10 minutes too long when he could have been here in a minute.  the guy drove in circles and the wrong way...  wasted my time for 20 minutes now!!!!
MSG|564| h
MSG|565| i requested trip and when i walked out the car pulled away and he didnt answer his phone
MSG|566| hello, i called an uber pool to the wrong location and cancelled within a couple of minutes to rebook the right location. thank you
MSG|567| on friday, i was assigned to this driver named aziz. when trying to explain to him where i was, he was speaking very rough which made me feel uneasy. i cancelled the ride and tried to lake another one but he stayed in the area for 10 minutes so i kept getting assigned to him. when i used the lyft app and got a different driver. i went outside my apartment and saw that he was waiting in fron to my apartment now. when i started walking towards the other car, he drove off in a hurry. it's been a few days since then and i just got the same driver which makes me uncomfortable. is there a way to block this driver from getting my rides unbeknownst to him?
MSG|568| driver clicked to pick us up from a long way away. she was completing another trip and there were closer drivers. i cancelled and she clicked on us again. waiting way too long.
MSG|569| i give him  direction to were i was at he told me that i did no where i stay at i ask him can you please  tell with apartment  you are at he said he did not know. he told me that i need to cancel  this trip because  he's  not going to cancel  it
MSG|570| driver started before i was in car so i cancelled.
MSG|571| my driver refused my trip and started my trip without me i want my money credited to my account
MSG|572| my driver refused to take me and was rude and nasty please do not match me with this driver again he also seemed to be under the influence of alcohol
MSG|573| i waited 34 min's and he never showed up, i texted him 2 asking we're he was and could not explain, i just got out of chemo and very sick but i still waited for him , no show so return my money
MSG|574| refused my destination and made me miss my flight
MSG|575| the driver did not come to the right place to pick me up. i would like have my cancellation fee waived
MSG|576| he did not take me to my destination because he said his work was on the opposite way of where i was going. very unprofessional
MSG|577| driver never moved. called him twice.  i think he is asleep. please remove cancellation fee.
MSG|578| the driver stopped at mcdonalds and as i began to call numerous times she would not answer the phone therefore causing me to be late and i had to cancel and get another ride
MSG|579| i would like my cancellation fee waived
MSG|580| my driver took longer than expected he was making different turns and wasnt driving directly to my direction i waited for him for more than 14 minutes like the app say  i need my money back is not fair
MSG|581| uber driver gave me wrong information and left me in a random gas station after telling me to cancel my ride. very unhappy.
MSG|582| my uber driver gave me incorrect information. i asked if it was possible to change locations and he advised me to cancel the uber (while we were in motion) and we book the trip with the updated address and that he will receive it on his end. i did as told and it did not work that way. he ended up leaving me in a random gas station. he stated that he could no longer take me even though i was following what he was saying. please review this trip, im very upset. i had to wait for another uber to pick me up so thats two trips and two chargers. im very unhappy if it couldnt be dont i would of understood and stayed with the same address but i was told to cancel and rebook.
MSG|583| the driver didnt moved and after a long time waiting i had to cancel
MSG|584| driver picked up a different passenger
MSG|585| i was quoted a wait time of 8 minutes and after 16 minutes it still said i had to wait another 6
MSG|586| it said that i didnt get charged but i got a receipt from my bank saying i got charged $17 anyways.
MSG|587| i waited for 7 minutes even though he was only few hundred yards away. his car kept going back and forth. he did not pickup his phone. i called again and then he picked up and hung up on me. never came to pick me up and i had to cancel
MSG|588|46 arrival time. had to cancel and get another uber to make a meeting
MSG|589| this driver went the opposite way from me  shit tried calling him multiple times
MSG|590| i rebooked within 5 mins
MSG|591| hello! my uber driver went in the opposite direction than where we were supposed to meet. i was at the location and i even sent him a message saying i was at the pickup location. it said he was 10mins away from me and soon it kept being a further wait time saying he was 14-15mins away. i tried to call him asking where he was and he hung up on me. i called him a bunch of times after that but he kept on ignoring my calls. i was not picked up. i would give him zero stars if i could. he should be banned from uber. i have never experienced this much unprofessionalism and rudeness from a driver. i would like a refund for my cancellation fee for my trip.
MSG|592| i was in an uber ride that my driver cancelled and my driver told me to request another ride so i would match with him. i was not matched with him so i cancelled. i had this ride matched for about two seconds. remove this fee
MSG|593| driver was not moving for a long period and then unexpected took a different route. was not moving towards me. please review. thank you
MSG|594| my driver drove away when he saw me approaching the car. i am 8 months pregnant!!!! he didn't want to pick up a pregnant woman! i called him immediately and texted three times and no reply!!! i am disgusted!
MSG|595| no
MSG|596| unable to locate driver
MSG|597| this driver charged me for a ride,that i never got.i don't have much money,and i'm extremely upset
MSG|598| i took a $11 carpool fare, after a minute while im inside the car uber app cancelled my ride, and fare was changed to $15+ ride, i did try to take the so the driver can still get my request while im inside his car but the uber app is trying to give me a different driver, i tried 3 times and cancelled 3 times, it happens to me the same thing yesterday. uber is playing a very nasty game on our fare and rides. be honest uber!!!
MSG|599| i got into a uber pool, but the driver's app showed "route unavailable"... he was not willing to go forward because he said he wouldn't be paid. i canceled a block away from my pickup location and got charged...
MSG|600| someone else took my uber and i couldnt get in contact with the driver. i was waiting for the car and it said the trip was already in progress
MSG|601| my driver picked up someone who is not me thinking it was me and then pressed pick up on his app thus charging me for a ride i was not on and making me late to where i was going
MSG|602| hi, my uber driver started the trip without me
MSG|603| my driver would not come to the designated rideshare area for dtw and i did not feel comfortable going to a different location when all approved uber drivers are supposed to pick up at this location
MSG|604| my driver never showed up. i ordered a pool trip, the driver picked up a second rider but never showed up to my address. i waited approx. 20 minutes before i canceled and ordered a new trip. if you review the trip immediately after is the trip i used. i would like my 8.78 credited back to me.
MSG|605| he was taking way too long i had elderly people standing
MSG|606| as soon as the driver and i were matched i called him and asked whether he had a car seat for a toddler. he said yes he did and verbally confirmed. we then waited for him to arrive and when he showed up his car did not have a car seat. when i asked him why he said yes over the phone he just acknowledged that he lied. assumed we would just get in the car anyway.
MSG|607| i ordered a ride just a short time ago today from work where the driver arrived at the correct building but on the opposite side of where i was, i called the driver after he arrived to tell him but he did not answer and then he left and started driving on the highway towards chicago but never cancelled the trip. i did not cancel right away because i didn't want to get charged a fee so i continued to call numerous times and still he did not answer so i continued to wait and he still did not cancel. i ended up cancelling but was charged a fee. my time spent waiting and being charged for this drivers mistake is inconvenient. i believe the driver's name was jose
MSG|608| i wasnt picked up at all and the ride was active, i cancelled because i didnt get my uber
MSG|609| i was waiting for my driver for 20 minutes and she started the trip before i was even near the car and walked to meet her where she said she was in two different locations even though i explained where i was and had my live location on the entire time. i could not understand where she was and she refused to move so i had to cancel the trip and just order a new uber.
MSG|610|06 and said he refused to wait i could either come now or he was leaving. i want my cancellation fee back.
MSG|611| the first words out of his mouth were, im not loading that. today is the move out day for notre dame, a well established fact in the community and it is more than likely that he has been picking up students all day who are doing the same thing. now i do not have a problem loading my own things into the car, i expected to do so. the problem was the he was an asshole about having to wait for me to load it in the car. since i know drivers can charge for wait time, like if you are longer than 2 minutes getting to your car, i told him to go ahead and start charging me. he said he gets paid for people not time and proceeded to be very rude about the fact i was using uber to move myself out of my college dorm, since i had no other options. refusing to deal with him being extremely offensive, i told him i would cancel the ride. i barely had the words out of my mouth before he sped off. he was an absolute jerk. i have never had a problem with an uber driver before. i am extremely disappointed and upset about my experience. i should not be treated like that. had he explained he did not want to help me load the car for this or that reason, fine. i did not expect him. had he been gracious about the situation, i would have compensated him was a good tip. instead, i was made to feel bad. the whole experience was witnessed by a woman directing traffic on campus. she saw how rude he was that since her shift was ending, she offered to drive me to where i was going and recommended i file a complaint and hope the driver gets fired. he should not come on to notre dame campus on move out day and expect to not get a student moving out of the dorms. at the very least, i would like to be refunded for this experience. in my opinion, his driving record should be reviewed and he should possibly be fired or suspended. he is not entitled to treat people like he treated me and needs to be punished for it.
MSG|612| i got a notification from the app that something went wrong and my ride was canceled, so i called a ride using another app. then i got an uber notification that a car had arrived. there seems to have been some kind of app error, so would like the cancellation fee reversed. thank you for reviewing
MSG|613| i dont know what happens to the driver,  i need my refund please.
MSG|614| i have a different issue. i bought a round fare trip and i only took it one way. i was charged $9.49 for each way on this day. the 24hrs were up before i could take the return trip. am i going to see a refund for the return trip? i didn't take the trip so there should be a refund for the return trip that i didn't take. please review my fare or trips taken after i bought the round trip package. thank you!!
MSG|615| i called an uber to terminal 7 passenger pick up a at jfk. i waited for 15 minuets before the driver moved. i then waited over 20 more minuets and the driver never arrived. he insisted he was at my pick up location but the map showed him at a completely different terminal and still said 6 minuets away. uber failed me tonight. after a delayed flight getting in after midnight with work in the morning i waisted nearly 45 extra minutes waiting for an uber. i decided cancel and call a lyft after the driver stopped answering my calls. i was picked up in 3 mins by lyft. i cant believe this to be honest ive never had an experience like this, but it seriously makes me consider which service to choose. as a platnium\nmember with uber, i have been very loyal, but after moving to a new city maybe uber just isnt the service to use here.
MSG|616| the trip was canceled which no one canceled the trip and i was already riding for a couple miles toward my destination. my driver had to drop me off at the middle of no where due to the error
MSG|617| driver never picked me up though i waited at the designated location and he kept driving away.
MSG|618| never showed up
MSG|619| i didn't receive a cancelation fee but i thought this driver needed to be reported. this driver picked up my fare and sat in the same spot did not drive towards me or answer the phone when i called several times. drivers like this are inconveniencing drivers like myself that use this service everyday what pick up a fare if your are not going to pick up the rider
MSG|620| no
MSG|621| driver had a different car and different license plate, i have pictures.
MSG|622| no
MSG|623| he told me to cancel the trip so i did is not fare that i get penalized
MSG|624| hi; i was sharing a pool and my co-riders who happened to be on the same street jumped in and i got left behind.  i asked driver to cancel and ordered a new one.  honest mistake but dang, was hoping to get another car quicker.
MSG|625| driver was driving farther and farther away from the direction of my pickup location-  showed no signsof coming to get me.  please refund me.  im on disability.
MSG|626| driver never picked me up and continued my ride i waited for him 15minutes and he was very far away and wouldnt pick up my phone calls!
MSG|627| its shows on my bank statement that i was charged twice for $12.05
MSG|628| this doesn't apply to the above. however i was requested uber pool and changed to uber x because i needed to get where i needed very soon and i did. now i need the$5.85 back which you charged me for uber pool. i'm showing it on my bank account but not credited receipts and for uber x charged me with receipts.\nplease act now. please return the $5.85 right now you have been doing this several times what's wrong? adam jemal
MSG|629| driver was not coming to my pick up spot
MSG|630| the driver never came to the meeting location and the app showed that i was on the trip when i never even saw the car. i need my full refund.
MSG|631| this isnt about a service animal but its impossible to contact uber these days. i waited forever and the driver kept going in circles and the price went up and he didnt answer his phone i had to cancel. i ask my self why i keep using uber this keeps happening
MSG|632| she literally had me wait for her and didnt move from her spot, now im about to be late for work !
MSG|633| i was asked by the driver in the middle of trip to stand out in the road so he can go and pickup other passenger, thats completely unfair to me that he expects me get out of the car in middle of the trip. actually i had to bear a lot of inconvenience due to that, me and my wife has to stand out on the road and book another cab after half of the trip and i was also delayed to reach my destination due to this
MSG|634| driver did not pick me up
MSG|635| driver never arrived and tried to scam several others by confirming and not showing up
MSG|636| i asked him who he was here for and he wouldnt tell me and screamed at me to just get in the car. i thought i was supposed to ask who he was here for ... and he said no you tell me who you are waiting for! i was scared and did not feel safe getting in his car.
MSG|637| i put the correct address in and hit submit to request a ride but it picked up a different location so i had to cancel it and to put in another location so he charge me for that and i would like to dispute it the gps system i guess is not accurate because lately ive been putting in the address is in a pick up another address instead of the one that i put in
MSG|638| driver refused to pick my grandma whos in a wheel chair at destination.. was texted to get jump in quickly something that we obviously could not do, reason why we requested a van for wheelchair assistance.. then was texted again and told to wheel her a block away where he was parked..
MSG|639| i believe this driver was purposefully scamming to get the cancellation fee for the trip. upon ordering the uber the drivers location was extremely close to my pick up location . he then sent me a message saying it would take 45 mins due to traffic , there wasnt heavy traffic in the area and driving across all orlando wouldnt even take 45 mins. the driver preceded to drive further and further away from my pick up location , he was going in the complete opposite direction . i sent him multiple messages which went unanswered and even called to which i received no answer . the driver told me to cancel in his message which i shouldnt have to do due to it being his fault and being charged the fee.  after this hassle i ordered another uber who picked me up within 5 mins showing that the last uber driver was clearly lying . i know i havent been charged for the trip i had to cancel but i believe this uber was deliberately scamming to get the cancellation fee. i have used uber for lots of trips and this is one of few bad experiences i have had. i hope some action is taken against this driver .
MSG|640| im being charged $33.03 twice on my visa regarding this cancelled trip
MSG|641| my driver apperently picked up someone else and took them to my destination and i even told chad about this and he can verify for me because i called him immediately about what just happened and didn't know if i was still charged for someone else's trip
MSG|642| the uber pool route was so inconvenient that i had to leave the car. the trip wasnt completed when i got out so i had to cancel. it says i was charged over $21 for this trip. id like a full refund of the trip.
MSG|643| back seat extremely dirty and stained and strong smell of cigarette smoke i couldnt go far distance in this car
MSG|644| my driver never picked me up. he was driving to my destination so i am assuming he picked up the wrong person. he never picked me up and i checked and he was driving to my destination without having me in the car.
MSG|645| yes
MSG|646| my driver never picked me up and started the ride anyways.  i called and asked him to cancel,  as i was being charged.  he downplayed that i was only being charged .18 cents a minute, i said i still shouldnt be charged. i asked him to cancel on his end and he said he would, but never did
MSG|647| kenneth never picked us up but started the ride well before he was supposed to.  i asked him to cancel so i could get a new ride and he told me it was only costing me an extra 18 cents  a minute, but i insisted he cancel so i wouldnt be charged. he said he would but never did.  after a few minutes, still not picked up, i hit cancel so i can get a new ride and i was charged over 7 dollars.   then when i kept trying to get a new ride, he kept matching with me.  give me my money back in a refund, not credit, and permanently unmatch me with him please
MSG|648| the driver canceled and took way too long to get to me soo why im i being charged? pls this not not fair.
MSG|649| i don like he do to my place reporter
MSG|650| the ride said 5 minutes away for 3 minutes and the driver was not moving. i demand a refund.
MSG|651| i was waiting for a period of time. saw driver drive by my location. tried calling and got no answer. started walking to his car while calling again, still no answer. so i had to cancel. i am now late to my meeting cause i had to walk. i refuse to pay the $5
MSG|652| the ride was cancelled right after it was made. this app says i wasnt charged but uber took an amount of 12.72 out of my account. i am requesting a refund for this. thank you in advance!
MSG|653| the screen showed driver was 7 minutes away when he called me and told me he was going to be 17 minutes. i told him the screen said 7. he said he refused to cancel the ride, was very rude and hung up on me. i have screen shots if you need. i then got an email from amex that i was charged for the ride! this driver was argumentative and rude and not up to uber standards.
MSG|654| the uber driver told me to cancel my trip because he could not take me to my location i told him that if would not let me do it because it would charge me , so i asked him if it was okay for him to cancel it without charging me so that i could order another one and he got angry and proceeded to drive off without canceling my ride . so basically i was charged for a ride that i was not in , i want my money back
MSG|655| the trip was started without me being picked up. driver did not respond to text or calls. i'm not sure if anyone took this trip, but i didn't.
MSG|656| my driver drove by me twice and took 10 min to loop around grand central, had to cancel because he was taking so long
MSG|657| somebody else got in my uber ride whit out the driver asking and it gave someone else a ride thats why i canceled
MSG|658| the driver excepted the trip but i never got in the car and it wasn't moving on the map. can i please not be charged for this trip. i never got in the car.
MSG|659| no money
MSG|660| this driver refused to come and pick me up originally and he was sitting in his car down down the block. i called him and he lied and said he was dropping someone off and the uber app was lying about his location and eta. he said i would have to cancel him and pay the fee. when i did cancel, he drove by and honked at me. so i called another uber and it placed me with him, so i immediately cancelled. and now i was charged a cancellation for cancelling on a driver who was fraudulent and i had to cancel on already. this fee needs to be removed.
MSG|661| helllo! i need my refund asap! i ordered an uber, the time was 4 min wait, and j couldnt wait...i canceled immediately! then my phone died! please refund this asap. its not right to charge me for something i canceled within a minute and my phone dird
MSG|662| so i tried to get into a pool and he drove me close to my destination but one road was blocked so he drove all the way back basically to my house and dropped me off and wasted an hour of my time im really upset
MSG|663| my driver just cancelled without waiting, and was no where near my pick up destination. please refund asap
MSG|664|38 and i went back into the app and the ride did not move from where it was and i had to go to an app. i should not be charged a cancellation fee because of uber not having available drivers in my area
MSG|665| he didnt refuse my destination very creepy when he said he was at my location i can see if you kept saying was i could see you and i said will drive to pick me up at
MSG|666| i have charged 2 times cancellation charge on 05/26/2019. please kindly check and refund my cash back to my account please
MSG|667| hello, i had my amex cash benefit $15 since it is 1st day of month, so i tried to use that with this ride; however, i cancelled the ride. now i see i have only $2.40 left in my cash benefit why am i charged for full fare and deduct cash benefit ? the trip receipt shows as 0
MSG|668| he just left and charged me like i was in the car.
MSG|669| i got charged two times times this morning  ,  $ 4.79 the first time i don't know why can you please verify and give me my money back
MSG|670| my driver took another passenger that wasnt me so i cancelled the trip
MSG|671| 1. i shouldn't be charged cancelation as i'm gold and i did request a car in 15 mins. 2. the eta to get the car was 2 mins and then it changed to 13 mins which i couldn't wait for
MSG|672| have had prior trips with this driver. dirty car and has a pet in the car. i would prefer to not be matched with this driver again
MSG|673| i wanted to do an uberpool express but the app asked me to walk to a location that was completely blocked off by construction, making no sense. i was forced to canceled and pay a higher price to take an uberx instead which is not what i wanted or anticipated.
MSG|674| i booked a ride with forrest at the detroit international airport. he drove off with someone else. i canceled the ride and was charged $11.92. please refund me asap. i am livid.
