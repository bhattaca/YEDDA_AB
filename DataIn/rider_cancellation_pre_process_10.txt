MSG|1499| i wasnt in the car he accepted the ride and i wasnt even in the vehicle
MSG|1500| i need my money back
MSG|1501| the driver pull up and when i tried to enter the car he said he couldnt take me because he had a call.. the driver was unprofessional and rude
MSG|1502| matthew did a great job.  my complaint is with a driver named edwin, who accepted my trip, then called me to ask my destination, then refused the trip.  my understanding is that drivers must accept the trip regardless of (local) destination, and cannot cherry pick the trips they want based on location.  again, the driver who accepted the trip, matthew, did a great job.
MSG|1503| very rude, almost ran me over, didn't even listen to where we were going
MSG|1504| hi, i checked my cc statement, and was charged 36.00 for nothing. can you please take a look into this?
MSG|1505| my bank statement shows that i was charged for this trip
MSG|1506| the driver wasnt coming towards my location he was in laguna hills and it was showing that i was already in the car while i was waiting for him at irvine spectrum center. i had to cancel the ride because he wasnt replying to my text or call and it was 12 in the morning and i had to get home. on my account it shows that im charged $10.33 for a ride i didnt get.
MSG|1507| i wanted to request uber x.
MSG|1508| my driver picked up the wrong person . he never had me in the car
MSG|1509| picked up wrong passenger as well as spoke little to none english
MSG|1510| didnt have space in boot for two suitcases i shouldnt be charged for this - terrible service
MSG|1511| the drop off address appeared to not be correct once the trip began.  i could find no way to correct/modify the drop off address within the app.  both the driver and i became frustrated and he dropped me off immediately in a different location (2999 sw spokane st, seattle, wa) so i didn't get any farther away from my desired drop off point.  can i please receive a $6.70 credit for this trip?
MSG|1512| in this case, my driver saw how much stuff i had and then said it couldnt fit and drove off. he didnt even try to see if the few boxes i brought with me would fit in his car. he just said it wasnt going to fit and told me to cancel. which in my opinion is poor customer service on his behalf. he literally drove an suv and told me i shouldve picked black suv when ordering uber instead of uberxl. im assuming this so he could get paid more. but this encounter caused me a lot of stress considering i had to move out of my dorm and into an apartment that same day without having anyone to help me move. i wouldve appreciated it if he wouldve tried to see if my items would fit. the next uber that came also drove an infinity suv that was the same size and able to fit in all my belongings ( i have pictures to prove it as well) . the distance i was traveling was only 15 minutes away so i dont understand why this driver asked me to cancel and order a black suv instead of uberxl when the car wouldve probably been exactly the same.
MSG|1513| driver was already at location and too far from where we were at
MSG|1514| the driver saw that i had luggage and was going to airport and said he couldnt take me and left. this is very unprofessional. then i tried to get another uber and the fee was 2x the one before. this is not a way to treat a customer. very disappointed u
MSG|1515| my driver didnt pick me up but started the trip.
MSG|1516| hi there - shannon drive 8 minutes to get to us when she was supposed to arrive in under 2. im not sure why i was leveraged a fee when i waited 4x the amount for her to arrive.
MSG|1517| the driver refused the ride and said he would cancel it but he didn't cancel and i was charged the ride fare. hence i cancelled it from my side. but still i got the cancellation fees. please help me with it
MSG|1518| i couldnt find my driver. i want a refund
MSG|1519| driver requested my ride but the stopped at a shell gas station. when i called he mentioned he need to get gas and would be right there to pick me up from bwi. after a more time passed on from the driver not moving towards my location, i call three times and was sent to voicemail. at the point i canceled my ride and requested a new driver.
MSG|1520| had to cancel  bc he hit some pot hole an got a flat tire
MSG|1521| i was charged double, cancellation fee of $5 and extra $6.90 which i would like to dispute.
MSG|1522| my driver was parked in the same place for over 10 minutes and was not moving towards my location
MSG|1523| my driver didnt even arrive at my location and it already said i was on the ride with her then i tried to call and text and she never answered
MSG|1524| the driver called me and said they were stuck in a flooded area there was a thunderstorm when i received a call from the driver i deserve a refined because i couldn't wait any longer
MSG|1525| i would like to get my refund for this trip, which is $33.15.
MSG|1526| my driver never showed up i had this trip to the airport schedule several days in advance
MSG|1527| this driver i sorry pick up another passenger mr. me where so that i cancel the fee and the send me am at $9 charge to my account where anything that when to my destination
MSG|1528| i did not take this ride. i attempted to call and text driver but he did not stop and kept going. please refund me
MSG|1529| the driver was great.  for some reason he could not start the trip. he tried really hard but something just was not working. so we canceled the trip and started again.   therefore i dont feel i should be charged a cancellation fee. again tony was excellent. thank you.
MSG|1530| no
MSG|1531| no
MSG|1532| driver was arrested by police for a search in front of me so i had to cancel my ride to order a new ride
MSG|1533| the driver kept making the wrong turns to come to my location as if she didnt understand gps.
MSG|1534| driver did not move from initial spot since i requested the ride.
MSG|1535| there was a strong language barrier while we tried to communicate in english at the airport. as i tried to clarify what the driver meant, i was chastised or accidentally yelled at. aside from the awkward interaction, i could not understand if the driver was saying he had been on the upper level, was in the upper level, or was telling me to meet him on the upper level. this was after a few text messages exchanged in the uber app that told us to meet on the downstairs level. this, after to uber app indicated we all had to meet in the upper level to meet jfks time-indicated pick up policy.
MSG|1536| he never showed up to pick me up, did not answer his phone.  i canceled once i noticed that he claimed he picked us up, when he hadnt !  i did request a ride right after and did get another driver that picked us up from the same exact location (our hotel)
MSG|1537| that wasnt my price
MSG|1538| urgent! this driver is picking up passengers with the wrong license plate. the license plate does not match the same license plate as the one on the uber app. this is a huge safety issue for women. please correct as soon as possible! furthermore, i would like a full refund for this trip bc that is the reason why i did not accept this ride.
MSG|1539| the driver said he was there but he was not. then he said to cancel because he had to go. he was not at my location
MSG|1540| your driver asked me for my name and would not first offer hes here to pick up so and so. then he became rude
MSG|1541| no
MSG|1542| turning at an intersection
MSG|1543| my driver was far away
MSG|1544| no
MSG|1545| my trip continued after i got out of the car and the rate was 3x what i was quoted
MSG|1546| my card got charged
MSG|1547|00pm- so my friend drove us.
MSG|1548| your driver never showed up been waiting 20 mins when it was supposed to be 3 mins
MSG|1549| my driver never arrived.  for 5+ minutes it said she was one minute away and when i called her twice she never picked up. i cancelled because i had an appointment to make and did not have time to sit there and wait for my driver who did not seem to be coming anytime soon.
MSG|1550| i paid uberx to get to work on time, my job is only 10-12 minutes away from my house. i live in apartment complex the driver couldnt even come in the complex she made me walk to the entrance of my apartment,  then told me to cancel that she wasnt taking me anywhere while i was already in her car i told her no just to take me to my destination..... she refused and canceled. very rude from the start. people like her should not drive for uber.
MSG|1551| driver didnt show up to my location
MSG|1552| my driver cancelled immediately after he arrived, after id waited over 20 minutes. he refused to take me to my destination and then cancelled it. this was one of the most horrible experiences ive had with uber, since it forced me to miss an important meeting. im switching from uber after this.
MSG|1553| the uber driver told me he wasnt my driver
MSG|1554| what sucks about uber is when it says driver is "3 minutes" away for 15 minutes and when you cancel that ride because the jerkoff is just sitting there all day, and try to get another uber; your bullshit system gives me the same damn driver who sits there for 10, 15, 20 fucking minutes, but is "3 minutes" away the entire time. i'm tired of wasting my time. i will switch to lyft.
MSG|1555| 25 minutes is unacceptable wait time for a 3 mins ride
MSG|1556| this ride was canceled twice because i had the same driver you kept calling me to say that her car was full. this is not exceptable because this is a pool.
MSG|1557| i got charged 21.91 for my canceled trip and it was only supposed to be a 5 dollar fee, i also got charged a reversaluber ? for 16.91, when the only actual ride i took was for 12 dollars to my destination i would like a refund for the 38.82. since i did not take those rides.
MSG|1558| i was never picked up. i called the driver prior to pick up and after i'd seen that he said i was picked up and i clearly wasn't. he was not very pleasant about it either. i would like that cancellation fee removed because it was the drivers error and not mine. thank you
MSG|1559| he refused me & took another passenger right front of my eyes for cash! which is illegal in nyc. a driver with tendency to disobey rules & very unprofessional-rude to uber passenger.
MSG|1560| i ordered the uber and was told it would be a 4 minute wait time. i have a 2 month old baby with me so i had her ready, in her car seat, before i ordered so i wouldn't keep the driver waiting. i went outside with her and waited a total of close to 10 minutes, and my driver still had not arrived! at that point she was not happy to be sitting in the car seat and i had no choice but to cancel and order again after she calmed down. this was extremely frustrating for me and also caused me to be late to work. i would expect uber to compensate me for this major inconvenience and unprofessionalism.
MSG|1561| there was an extreme language barrier between my driver and i. not only could he not describe his surroundings he did not know where the location was. i spent over 10mins on the phone with him to help guide with no progress. i had to cancel the ride because my phone was on 1% and 0% progress was made.
MSG|1562| this is the 2nd time in 2 weeks where i have had a very unprofessional situation with my uber driver. last night she refused to take me to the airport (which is not a far destination) and made me get out of her car and take the cancellation fee because she told me she did not feel like going to hobby airport and needed to get gas uh not my problem. i am very lucky i made my flight hone
MSG|1563| my driver picked up the wrong people
MSG|1564| this is the second uber in a row ive had with smell of smoke in it. i took it last time and all my clothes smelled like smoke after.
MSG|1565| so apparently! asked her a question about something n i was honest n then she said no so then i was cancelled and still charged for the cancellation fee it wasn't even more then one minute so i feel that i should get my money back i don't work to be losing my money like that..so please return me my money...
MSG|1566| 
MSG|1567| the driver took long to my pick up
MSG|1568| driver never showed up to pick me up
MSG|1569| my driver drove past me and kept going
MSG|1570| the drive never moved was stopped by police i never went anywhere
MSG|1571| driver did not pick me up even when i was standing right there
MSG|1572| see above
MSG|1573| my driver picked up someone else!
MSG|1574| i got off from uber 45 mins ago and driver just completed my trip and charged more than double \ni didnt even dropped off on my location cuz she was taking wrong route
MSG|1575| i did not take this trip and was charged incorrectly. driver refused my ride.
MSG|1576| i was charged 16 dollars on my account of what this ride would have cost.my bank account shows a charge but not a refund since i cancelled uber my money should have been refunded or at least show in my statement as soon as i cancelled my trip.
MSG|1577| drove up aggressively. abrasive behavior.
MSG|1578| i booked trip. had to walk to pickup point. and then the app though i was on the car on the highway going to my destination when i had not even seen the car! i had notifications about dropping people off but i was not even in the car! had to book another ride
MSG|1579| he, the driver cancelled bc my son we 16.5 years old... he's been using uber for 2 years and this is the second time this has happened .  he needs uber to go to scholl.  rhen he call/booked uber again and the same guy pick up so he was charges twice for the cancellation.  i want the money refunded and a pilicy instituted where drivers can take kids to school.  it was fully authorized.  lyft at this point maybe lyft is better!!!
MSG|1580| the driver didnt pick me up and still start my trip, i am not on that car!
MSG|1581| we stood and waited for our ride. we saw the truck, walked up to it, and he drove off. we waited again, he came back around. we were sure he saw us so we walked up and tried to open the door. he drove off again and never came back. we ended up walking home.
MSG|1582| i need help as i canceled my last trip but got charged a full amount and not just the cancellation fee please help
MSG|1583| i ordered an uber pool. the driver picked someone else up first, never picked me up, and went to my destination without me....
MSG|1584| when the driver told me he had arrived he was not at my location
MSG|1585| driver was very rude talking to me i asked him to turn me back around and take me home i will find another uber thank you
MSG|1586| the driver basically snapped on me about the direction i asked driver to turn around and take me back home. i didnt feel safe with him at all. like if i said a thing else he probably would of dropped me off anywhere. so i told him to take me back home and i'll find a other uber.
MSG|1587| driver started ride and didnt pick me up
MSG|1588| the uber system changed my destination and the driver can not take me there. so he let me cancel the order. but that is not my fault!!!! i dont know why there always are some mistakes in uber system!!! i would like to ask refund! it is really wired that i was late for my schedule and even be changed by no reason!!!!!!
MSG|1589| i confirmed with the driver he was on his way. during his drive i messaged him that we had 4 people in our party.  1 was a toddler. all of a sudden i got a cancelled trip fee. he showed up 1 min later and took another fare. he was rude and yelled at me!!!  he was the rudest uber driver i have ever met.
MSG|1590| i couldnt find my driver and i had to immediately request a new driver.
MSG|1591| this driver picked up the wrong person!! he never picked me up and suddenly it said i was on my ride so i tried to cancel. i never took this ride.
MSG|1592| the driver did not pick me up but on the app it marked he did. i would like a refund.
MSG|1593| my gps on my app is technical difficulties its sending drivers to the wrong house please refund my money ive been a loyal customer and i dont have these type of problems often
MSG|1594| i was not picked up and the driver started the ride without me in the car can i have my refund for this ride please
MSG|1595| so as i was walking towards the uber drive bc of the message that usually reads along the lines of driver wont wait for more than two minutes  i saw the uber driver and then all the sudden he is going on the trip as if i was in his car already.
MSG|1596| yes
MSG|1597| yes
MSG|1598| driver picked up a group of male passengers within my view and continued the trip, ignoring my phone calls
MSG|1599| it never showed up
MSG|1600| today  i was supposedly  i was in her car but she never  came for me i wait 13 minutes but she never came i try  to contact her but never answer
MSG|1601| tried calling driver but was not picking up to specify pickup location near designated port pickup
MSG|1602| i wasnt in the uber, he accepted and left without me!!!!
MSG|1603| the driver never showed up to my pickup, started the trip without even picking me up and in texts claimed to be at the location.  this kind of thing is happening way to frequently and the amount of money i spend daily with uber to have no immediate credit available and to have to wait for 5 business days to get my refund on my card is beyond inconvenient.  is there anyway to just issue a direct uber credit for a ride instead of refund back to my card?  what kind of action happens with your fraudulent drivers who seem to be growing everyday?  thank you.
MSG|1604|51am i had to cancel the "scheduled pick up" and request a new pick up.   i don't know why the app never requested rmthe ride for me even though i scehduled in advance - which uber encourages people to do.
MSG|1605| he never showed up. then i called him 6x and he never answered. i cancelled only bc i needed to re-book a trip. i watched him on my phone fake the trip!
MSG|1606| i waited for 30 min for an uber and one never came. if anything i should be given a credit.
MSG|1607| the uber driver took the wrong person and drove off without me being inside the car. therefore i believe i shouldnt get charged the cancellation fee due the fact that it wasnt my mistake.
MSG|1608| had to cancel a ride and now my app isn't allowing me to request a ride
MSG|1609| i requested an xl and he refused to take us because his car was only for 6 people
MSG|1610| i want my money back
MSG|1611| driver never picked me up
MSG|1612| my driver messaged me to ask if trip was local or long distance. i didnt respond as it shouldnt matter. he then cancelled trip. ill use a taxi moving forward if this is how uber drivers are going to act. i shouldnt be asked that question.
MSG|1613| driver never came. didnt answer call or text. i cancelled and rebooked three times and you gave me the same driver. never came. switched to lyft.
MSG|1614| i wasnt billed for this trip and i should be. i canceled the trip after the driver dropped me off because he forgot to update the app i arrived. he should be paid for his service.
MSG|1615| i just updated my app. i wouldn't give a option to add a second person. i then was charged for the ride upon the driver arriving i asked him if it was okay because i know he
MSG|1616| the uber drive need to giver by my money
MSG|1617| cancel my trip and they charged me i cancelled at the same time i confirm the uber thank i would like to know if you can return my money because i pay for nothing thanks.
MSG|1618| i tried requesting a trip that said it should be here in 4 minutes but instead kept getting paired with rides that were 10-12 minutes away. i canceled within 30 seconds and was still charged.
MSG|1619|54am. the uber pool route all of a sudden added many pickups and dropoffs in very far areas out of the way of mu destination. i had to leave the car and get another uber because i couldnt get to work so late. the uber pool routes have been really bad recently. you are charging me more than if i had stayed in the car, this makes no sense. please review this. thanks
MSG|1620| i was still charged the full fare on my bank account
MSG|1621| my driver indicated he picked me up even though i was not in the vehicle, based on that information, i must assume he picked someone else up and was gonna charge me for it
MSG|1622| excuse me, i agree to pay cancellation fee, but you charge more than 100$ for my canceled trip. please pay back.
MSG|1623| the driver drove right past my pickup point without slowing down much less stopping, despite me waving my phone and arms around, got on the freeway, drove away without ever turning around to pick me up, and made no attempt to cancel the trip in order to force me to eat the cost of cancellation.
MSG|1624| my trip to airport was cancelled twice that i set up the previous evening, now i don't have funds on my card to get to the airport. i expect to he refunded and receive a free ride. should be been at the airtport
MSG|1625| it should be charged to my paypall account on file.
MSG|1626| i canceled a ride i requested almost immediately but was still charged. its not showing up on my recent trips but its on my bank statement. i need that money back.
MSG|1627| driveway pickup and her vehicle had cigarette on floor /car was dirty please do not charge me
MSG|1628| sorry i wasnt charged a fee but i dont understand why my uber was cancelled 3 times in a row for a pick up
MSG|1629| the driver didn't stop for me and i still got charged. i  shouldn't be paying if the driver cancels, i even had to get another uber pool and was late to work.
MSG|1630| orlay did not stop the ride even after he had someone else in his car. he was also not in the correct pickup location which made it difficult to locate him.
MSG|1631| the driver took forever to come pick me up. first he cancelled the ride & the second time i ordered it again he accepted my request again then i could tell nothing about his whereabouts on my uber app. after 15 plus mins of wait i ended up cancelling it and got charged $7. kindly review and refund this charge on my card on file.
MSG|1632| when i ordered it was a bmw x5
MSG|1633| wait time was way too long wasnt waiting
MSG|1634| i accidentally charged an old friends card by mistake ending in 9126. i cancelled the ride but they still got hit with the $3.00. i would just like to change that $3.00 from their card to my card. thank you
MSG|1635| driver started ride and never picked us up.
MSG|1636| my driver requested that i cancel the trip due to traffic.  i did cancel it but was charged.  he told me he would reverse the charge but did not.
MSG|1637| my driver never showed up to get my daughter and never contacted me. i want to be fully refunded since no ride was done
MSG|1638| driver was at wrong location!! and was very rude when trying to connect for my ride had to cancel in order to get a secure ride home because he was rude and was not coming to my location!
MSG|1639| hello, i wouldnt exactly say he was rude but i told him i was adding a stop into my trip and he mumbled something. i added the stop but he continued to the original destination and didnt stop where i requested (920 sepulveda). he also held up a right turn lane and the car behind honked multiple times until our driver pulled into the correct lane then our driver started honking back at the other driver. that was pretty unprofessional.
MSG|1640| i requested regular ride and he was taking me to another location to pick someone up that isnt right
MSG|1641| i was incorrectly charged.
MSG|1642| the driver never showed up and would not answer the phone
MSG|1643| my driver didnt seem to realize she was supposed to pick me up at the airport and bring me to the hotel. she never picked me up and started the trip. please remove the charge
MSG|1644| hi, when i requested the ride, the rides i got are way too far (more than 10 mins wait) so i have to cancel right away. dont understand how the cancellation fee apply here because the driver was not on his/her way at all. i cancelled immediately after find out driver too far!
MSG|1645| i was picked up from walmart paid for 1 stop at mcdonalds which is next to my pick up driver got upset that i wanted to go through drive through instead of inside he then yelled at me pointed his finger in my face and told me to get the hell out of his car i told him why because i wanna go through the drive thru i paid for this stop its quicker. i asked him to cancel my trip if he wanted me to get out so i could book another uber he refused and started clacreaming making me feel unsafe i called the police and let them know what happened he then told me while officers were there that he canceled it but he did not i showed them and i canceled i filed a complaint against him with officers i believe this driver had some other issues going on i just want my money back that was charged for waiting for police to arrive because he didnt take me anywhere he isnt the type of driver you should have driving woman around he bucked at me he  really wanted to hit me
MSG|1646| my credit card was charged for this entire trip when on the app it says i cancelled it in time. i would like a refund of this trip.
MSG|1647| not understanding why i was charged $7.60 for an pool express ride ? i was quoted $4 something, not 7.60 ? what is going on ?
MSG|1648| the receipt says zero but my uber cash balance was reduced. please refund.
MSG|1649| he was low key saying some anti black things the last half of my trip and i know that's not how uber would like to present themselves.
MSG|1650| my driver could not reach the desired location for a prolonged period.. much longer than had initially anticipated. so i had to cancel the trip
MSG|1651| hello! i tried to contact this driver 7 times as he was not moving at all towards me. he was only a block away and was ignoring my calls. then because we were late we had to take a regular taxi as we were going to be late. i dont have paying a cancellation fee if i have too but he was a block and a half away and 4 lights worth of traffic came by, he never moved and would not answer. please refund me
MSG|1652| this inquiry is unrelated to this trip. i just took a trip for $9.03 and dont see an email receipt or see it on my trip history. can you advise?
MSG|1653| the driver started the trip without picking me up. i saw just around the corner and saw him drive away. i would like to be refunded as i never actually completed the trip.
MSG|1654| wait was to long it said 4 mins and it was 15 mins
MSG|1655| i have waited for 10 min and my driver cancelled the trip and uber assigned another driver where wait time is 13 min. how am i get charged for this?
MSG|1656| my cancellation fee not refunded yet
MSG|1657| my driver didnt pick me up! then proceeded to drive away from my location and didnt answer any of my texts. i told him he had the wrong passenger and asked him to cancel my trip. i need this refunded right away!
MSG|1658| i watched him sit there for over 3 minutes not moving, so i canceled.
MSG|1659| $9.85
MSG|1660| dear uber, my phones battery was low so i had to cancel my ride.
MSG|1661| she pulled off on me
MSG|1662| hey i didn't mean to cancel the whole thing, i was just trying to cancel the second location i added and i don't want to receive a bad rating, nor for this guy to get in trouble. he was great and professional and waited for me. i just ended up needing longer than i thought so i tried to cancel the second stop. how do i fix this and tip him and rate him 5 stars?
MSG|1663| my drivers eta changed from 5 minutes when the driver accepted the ride to 7 minutes after waiting for 3 minutes which is why i cancelled the ride. even before this another driver had cancelled the ride after accepting. i cancelled because my estimated arrival time to my destination went more than 5 minutes beyond ubers original estimate due to all of this.
MSG|1664| driver left without me. when i called her - she said that she doesnt speak english. and start driving away (i saw it on the map). please refund me
MSG|1665| the app malfunction twice in a row.  the driver never picked me up.  this was not my pickup or drop off location.
MSG|1666| i cancelled before 2 mins
MSG|1667| i have photo and video that my drive never came near my location and should not be liable for this cancellation
MSG|1668| she left my location without cancelling my ride on the app it said i was still in the car so i had to cancel it which made me pay a fee when she was the one that left the location
