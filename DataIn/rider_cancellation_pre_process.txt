MSG|0| there was an error with 2 rides then both got cancelled, your driver told me i have to get out. he left me stranded in a dark place, i didn't know where i was left. it was a dangerous area felt scared and unsafe. i told him it's unsafe, he's respond was i don't care you have to get out. i had two rides show on my phone but he was the 1st one there so i cancelled the 2nd ride but made a mistake on picking the right ride..then your driver had another pickup which was cancelled too. i just felt i was dropped off to an unsafe area and i didn't know.
MSG|1| i had the most important meeting of my life today. ive ordered ubers plenty of times and knew that this would be most reliable source of transportation for such an important morning. once the app notified jeffrey was here, i looked around and saw no cars. i walked up and down the street, i called two times and both calls were cancelled. i even texted him, but nothing. finally, i recognize his car by his license plate, since he had no sticker or no identification of him being an uber driver, i approached the car and ask if he was jeffrey my uber driver. to my face he denies being my uber driver, i then show him the information on the app that matches the car and show him the picture that matches him, and he continues to deny this is him. at this point i am already running late because jeffrey accepted my ride  but never made any effort to actually take me my to my destination. not only was he parked the entire time( i have pictures) but he failed to even have any uber stickers or gear which would allow me to easily identify him. i had to order another uber, but my morning has already been ruined. i am now running late and to make matters worse, i was charged a cancellation fee for the most unprofessionals service that i have ever received in my entire life. i wish people like this could receive a rating for being completely unprofessional. if i could, i would easily rate him negative stars because even giving a one would be too generous. i feel humiliated and completely appalled by the behavior of this man. these are the kind of experiences that push people to utilize other services such as lyft instead of uber.
MSG|2| i had scheduled a uberxl for additional room for my luggage. the car never came at my scheduled time. i had to call a uberx economy which was the only car available. now im late 30 minutes late to the airport and the car is too small for all my belonging
MSG|3| i rode with him prior and tried to change destination when we were enrout to my original destination but it created another trip which i cancelled while in vehicle with him
MSG|4| address was incorrect i tried to change it while the ride coming but couldnt so i had to cancel
MSG|5| driver came then wouldnt pick us up due to too many bags with us.
MSG|6| please ensure that i am not charged for this cancellation fee. your drivers should not pick up fares before they have finished their last ride as it wastes your customers time. you should not charge cancellation fees to customers because you have wasted their time with poor policies.
MSG|7| i was not charged, and i thank you, but there should be a way that you make the drivers have their cars in working and running condition. my daughter and i, we where more than a 1/2 hour late and this driver did not contact me. i reached out to him then after a few text he told me he had to check on the coolant in his car. the drivers must make sure cars are in working order to drive. because of his negligence my daughter was sad and i was upset and ruined our trip out. the next driver was on it and very professional.  not this driver.
MSG|8| i was originally requested to be picked up in four minutes. after over 10 minutes the car drove by where my pick up point was and then dropped me. i was then switch to another driver which was 10 minutes away. after 30 minutes of waiting between two different drivers i cancel. please remove any cancellation fee i will not be using the service moving forward. thank you
MSG|9| driver cancelled. no one else was available. i have a charge on my credit card!
MSG|10| the driver never showed up to my pick up location and started the trip when he never showed up. i tried contacting him through txt and calls but he never responded so i canceled the trip but i am still getting charged for it.
MSG|11| yes
MSG|12| driver refused to take me to my destinatoln
MSG|13| very unprofessional, rode past me stopped at gas station across from me and the went in a whole other direction!  then when i tried to contact him he said his car broke down! but was still traveling. a simple phone call instead of having me wait!  very very unprofessional.
MSG|14| driver was 10 minutes away, which was too long of a wait. please refund.
MSG|15| driver went to a different location. when i called him, he started shouting rudely in a foreign language. i should be fully refunded and not charged additional fare for next driver. this driver should be banned from driving for uber.
MSG|16| can i please have my credit from the cancellation fee refunded to the credit card it was charged to? necessary due to business purposes.
MSG|17| smelled bad
MSG|18| he picked up someone else so i had to order another uber
MSG|19| i cancelled my ride because my driver drove past my pick up spot and continued to keep driving away. i requested a new ride.
MSG|20| i was stranded at my location and the driver never arrived
MSG|21| my driver told me he was in 20 minutes of traffic even though there was no traffic. he clearly didnt want to drive me because he was in a suburban and i didnt pay for a black car.
MSG|22| i had ordered the uber as i was exiting my residence. i live in an apartment and my building was a little bit away from the front gate. as i was coming down the stairs out of my building i get a phone call from the driver yelling at me asking where i am. i try to tell him what's going on but he just continues to yell at me which in turn i tell him to cancel the ride then. i waited for him to cancel it but he was refusing, i needed to get to work so i in turn cancelled the ride. he was so unprofessional and inconsiderate of the circumstances. i should not be the one paying for his actions. help me out here. thank you
MSG|23| the driver told meit would be a 20 minute wait that turned into an hour. he also started the trip but never picked me up.
MSG|24| your app wasted my time looking for a driver when none. changing to lift now, uber is so big it bleeds profits through incompetence. i am a business consultant who can save your asses.
MSG|25| what ask a question was offer a pass for 24.99 try to accept it but was ask to use another card why when  i have funds on that card
MSG|26| my driver did not pick me up but passed me and continued going in the opposite direction of my pickup, towards my destination. i tried calling but he didnt answer so i had to cancel and request another ride because i was waiting outside on the rain for too long
MSG|27| the driver of the ford was there and he cancelled his self and helped me. but yall sent another driver and i had to cancel him cuz the ford driver was still helping me.
MSG|28| driver got pulled over by a cop!! had to be somewhere so had to jump out to get subway
MSG|29| after we got on the car and he said he is too tired to drive and asked us to get off the car. he is very very unprofessional. refusing destination just because hes tired? ridiculous. i want to get a refund for this not happened trip.
MSG|30| while we were on the way the driver had a flat tire so i had to call another uber about 4 mins into the trip and got charged 95% of the trip.
MSG|31| i was charged and i still dont see a refund and i need the money to get back home cause it drained my card
MSG|32| the location was wrong i was new to uber need a ride at 630 am may 25 to ohare. i did not realize that the location said the street over. so i corrected this by adding my home address .   once again please pardon the mistake as i will much need this service this morning , i dont want to go into a panic.
MSG|33| i was trying for 30 minutes to get an uber but the app wouldn't show a ride. i closed out the app and then it selected a driver after i made either plans. please refund my cancellation fee.

MSG|50| driver kept on driving around the block and would not come to the pick-up point. so i cancelled my trip and was charged $5.00.
MSG|51| hello, my driver was not following the uber maps directions to my destination. instead he went out of the way to my direction which made me feel very unsafe so i canceled my trip.
MSG|52| the driver never picked me up and started the ride many blocks away from my location. i need a refund immediately.
MSG|53| it took money after canceling
MSG|54| no
MSG|55| while waiting for my uber pool his evening i had two drivers cancel on me for some reason.  i was then connected with a driver that was 13 minutes away. after cancelling due to the absurd total wait time, i waited 5 more minutes to be connected to another driver. ultimately, i waited 20+ minutes just to be picked up from a college in san francisco. why did this happen?
MSG|56| waiting time was 7 min. after waiting for more than that, waiting time jumped to 12 min. so 19 min total. driver took a complete different route
MSG|57| my driver wouldn't come to my pick up address and argued that he was here. when he never came.
MSG|58| yall took 9.06$ out my account and i didnt get the ride
MSG|59| my uber refuse to pick up me, i called 4 times and text him but he never answered and he went to other way
MSG|60| my driver drove completely past me without stopping or slowing down and kept on going
MSG|61| he not move. he said i have arrived
MSG|62| before i approached his car i asked him what was the name of the person he was picking up. he said what? i said who are you picking up? he said whats your name? i asked him again to please tell me who he was picking up. he said you. so since he could not say my name, i was afraid to get in the car. he was very rude with an attitude as well.
MSG|63| driver did not come to my pickup and then proceeded to call me and curse me out using the f word
MSG|64| driver did not move
MSG|65| i think that you dont care or dont take my customer feedback seriously cause trust me i m going to start burning some of those ubers cars to the ground so that some other people can follow it, you cant just charge me on some bullshit and walk away while you fucked up my entire hussle , if you fuck with me i will fuck with you too. i maybe tne first guy who is going to start some crazy rebellious shit on those cars since i have been scammed for some stupid ass shit. i aint playing on this
MSG|66| my driver and i couldn't connect plus i got charged wrongly on my account, i got to be somewhere
MSG|67| the car either never showed up or someone else got in. there were multiple gray toyota camrys that showed up within a minute or so but none i saw had the right license plate. i dont know who took this ride but it wasnt me.
MSG|68| i was charged $13.67 and $13.47 for same ride and was quoted a different rate please return my refund did not authorize to charge my account so many times
MSG|69| i have matched with this driver before and requested to never be matched with him again. on a different uber account now all i am asking is not to be matched with him because he is a rude driver.
MSG|70| the driver was pulled over for not wearing his seat belt.
MSG|71| she did not drop me off where i requested
MSG|72| the driver was too far away
MSG|73| no wav rides available (first was canceled by driver) for almost 1.5hr! missed appointment, requesting $5 credit card refund instead of uber cash.
MSG|74| uber got a flat tire and had to stop on the side of the road
MSG|75| something was wrong with the app! it was shown that i am already in the car while i was not.. the app didnt update, i had to cancel the ride
MSG|76| driver left me by the highway where there was no place to get any other transportation ,he argue with me because i ask him to go a different route that thegps was sending him
MSG|77| i was trying to tell steven on my last ride that i had trouble using my friends card because she was going to pay for my uber to my home. she has used her card on previous trips for me. however, it overdrew my account because her card wouldn't be accepted by uber. i told steven that it charged my account instead of my friends. i am permanently disabled and on a fixed income. i would greatly appreciate if you can remedy this issue for me. it was the drivers negligence to hang up on me while we were trying to explain that the cancellation fee came out of my account instead of my friends. now i am stuck and have a lot to do tomorrow. please remedy this or i will move on to lyft.. also, i would appreciate your drivers to not hang up on me and fill them in on information that we are not aware of. yes.. i did record the conversation. thank you. 
MSG|78| the driver never came
MSG|79| i have had this driver before and thought i rated him low enough so he wouldnt pick me up again. when i saw him take my request i immediately canceled. i waited and tried again, he took my request again, i canceled. he did that five times until i finally changed to uberx. when i went out to take that uber this driver was waiting in front of my building yelling at me and i quickly hop in the other car and left. please mark this driver so he never picks me up again
MSG|80| i didn't get the car can you refund my cancellation fee refunded thx
MSG|81| i was charged four times the same acount of money for a trip that i didnt take. i want my money back because this trip was never taken

MSG|83| i was not able to get to the pickup area quickly enough. it was too far
MSG|84| couldnt find the car
MSG|85| it was a 4 stop ride starting at my friends house for her birthday and we spoke and he agreed to wait a few minutes for her to get ready and i told her to speak with him as well so he can see her face and then then i saw the ride was in  progress...and i said let me call my friend to see if it was her and she said no! so i cancelled the ride!
MSG|86| my car never came
MSG|87| the driver never came to the location i had selected and i was never picked up. no call, no text. i texted them and said i hadnt been picked up and there was no response.
MSG|88| i wasnt correctly charged a cancellation fee. i was still charged for the actual ride even though i never got in the uber.
MSG|89| driver never showed up and was not moving
MSG|90| i never got in the car but the app said i was already on my way home. i want a refund.
MSG|91|45 the frosty driver was a no show. the second driver called to confirm my location and then cancelled. the third driver was a minute away and never showed up, i waited 5 minutes and he continued to drive further away! this had been very frustrating! i should not be charged a cancellation fee, if anything i should be refunded for the half hour i wasted trying to get a ride!
MSG|92| i cancelled with this driver three times late last night / early this morning because he wasnt driving towards me. the app finally matched me with another driver on the third or fourth try, and i took that uber different car home. you have refunded the other cancellations; please refund this one. thank you.
MSG|93| i couldnt find the driver please reimburse me thanks
MSG|94| the driver did not pick me up. i shouldnt be charging a cancellation fee.
MSG|95| drivers app was not functioning properly. it would not start the trip as he drove in circles trying to confirm the trip. he tried restarting the app and his phone but that app still did not work. he had us cancel the ride trying to see if it would work  but it did not so we had to call another uber. i should not be charged the cancellation fee when it was uber apps fault.
MSG|96| the driver never picked me up, although the said he did. now my new request is $3 more.
MSG|97| my driver called and would not come pick me up at my location. he wanted me to walk to another location to meet him.
MSG|98| cancelled right away,still got charged. can you refund me the cancellation fee
MSG|99| driver accepted my request and continued to move away from airport. i asked and said he was getting gas. his vehicle continued to move away for another 10 minutes. showed another uber and they said he was lying.  very unprofessional and i used to use uber often. not any more. plus will tell about the bad experience in this somewhat small community.
MSG|100| no
MSG|101| the driver never picked me up. i texted and called but didnt receive a response
MSG|102| requested comfort
MSG|103| this driver never picked me up. someone else must have taken this trip. this driver called me from a location that i did not request a pickup from, but even after that never showed up. \n\ni waited a long time for his arrival
MSG|104| when i got in the car my driver said he did not want to drive to brooklyn. he refused to cancel the ride because he wanted the cancellation fee.
MSG|105| my driver did not speak english very well, so when he asked me to go to 84th street and not my designated location at 85th street and 1st ave i happily obliged. he was not there, and we went back and forth talking about 84th street until i finally had to give up because he was so confused. i am now late to my appointment and was charged a cancellation fee, that i would like to be reimbursed for. thank you.
MSG|106| hello you all charged me three times $11.24 one was cancelled but to other are still there. i never took the car nowhere never came and it was cancelled trip twice. so i need my money back in my account asap as fast as you took it o want it back i dont care if its in ride credit or in my account but i want it back. you can see those 3 crazy charges back to back and you will see i never got in no car
MSG|107| waited 10 minutes for her to arrive and she was across the street from me. therefore, i message her saying that and she went to the other intersection street and u turn and just vanish while i got the notification stating we were picking another person up. \ni contacted her because it stated that i was with her in the car when i wasnt. \nshe didnt bother to reply back to my messages and i even called her too. \ni needed to get another transportation method (lyft)\nvery unprofessional of her. \nshe didnt even give me 2 minutes to walk to her. \ni am truly disappointed.
MSG|108| my driver would not answer my calls or my texts and drove right by me while both myself and a valet gentleman tried to wave him down. utterly ridiculous. very frustrated.
MSG|109| i had to cancel as we seemed unable to get to our destination due to the 2019 five boro bike tour. i was charged $3.60 for this trip and then was charged $18.45 after canceling. would really appreciate a refund of $18.45, as this was out of our control. thank you.
MSG|110| the driver accepted before he meet me. ive never saw the car. he accepted, and go for a ride, without me! this is why i canceled
MSG|111| it was pitch black at night my uber was taking to long i called the driver and he answer and said cancel because he didnt want to pick up a bitch
MSG|112| i actually cancelled this on accident because the app wasnt working. i need my fare adjusted to the original amount. the driver took me to my destination and dropped me off. i need the rest refunded to my card.
MSG|113| i canceled within the first 2 mins and i realized i put the wrong pick up destination.
MSG|114| he never show up ..
MSG|115| this driver never came into may location.. this is my second  he's name it's always show up here .. this is a  fucking scam !!!
MSG|116| she seemed under the influence. had erratic and frenetic behavior but was not looking at traffic. we needed to get out at 5th and s highland because she pulled out on 5 th ave. without looking and almost killed us as 2 cars were coming the other way. she needs
MSG|117| the driver activated my ride but never picked me up.    i called him twice and finally he realized he was almost to my destination but had never picked me up.    hes cancelled the ride and left me back at my destination for 25 minutes.  i should not be charged!
MSG|118| my driver started my ride and never picked me up. this is incredibly frustrating and got charged for a ride that never picked me up.
MSG|119| hi i ordered a uber share for a trip but the driver didnt head my way at all even though he was few blocks away.he ended up going towards my destination without me.i was charged for waiting?
MSG|120| i cancelled the trip immediately when i realized the driver was over 6 minutes away. i should not be charged a cancellation fee because i cancelled within 2 minutes.
MSG|121| bro im looking to go home he was moving away from me imma need you to remove charge because you are not about to be driving away on my dime no ma'am.
MSG|122| i was on biscayne and 186th.
MSG|123| my uber driver never came and picked me up
MSG|124| i ordered this uber hoping not to run late. i received a 7 minute wait time. as i proceeded to finish up putting on my mascara and eyeliner i looked at my phone again to see zero movement from the driver. it still stood at 7 minutes showing the car twisting and turning. i canceled this fair due to no movement. it is really unfair to charge me this cancellation. clearly you people need to get your business in order.
MSG|125| the driver called and said he had a customer in his car and that he would be 10 mins.. im not paying this fee
MSG|126| can u please release my money
MSG|127| i received the drivers information as the system indicated, but the car type and plate did not match. i tried to locate the car showed on the app and it turned out to be another car. i canceled the trip, and made two more new requests and it was still the same driver with the wrong car type. please refund my cancelation fee and perhaps investigate?
MSG|128| i do not agree with these fees. when i ordered the trip all of a sudden my app did not show me anything else than i had to re enter my phone number with a text message code etc... meanwhile i was blind on the driver , trip, waiting time etc... so as i was in a hurry i took a yellow cab, and inside i started to insert my phone number. that is where i found out that a driver had taken my order and was waiting for me. not fair at all as i dont understand why my number was asked again, and why meanwhile it blocks the app!!
MSG|129| i ordered an uber and he never came. the expected wait time rose more and more until i had to call him (emmanuel). he told me that he was in a different city (brockton- the city i was supposed to be dropped off in). he, then, told me to cancel the ride because he was unable to cancel the ride from his end.
MSG|130| n/a
MSG|131| hi i ordered a round trip but after 2 min i understood that it is no needed  so the driver drop me after riding only 3 streets i understand that i need to pay cancellation fee but why in a same price of a round trip i drove only 3 street and he even didn't take me back to the original location please review the ride and i hope you will reduce the cancellation fee i drove 3 street and was charged 26 dollars
MSG|132| my driver picked up someone else and never answered my calls. left me for 15 minutes.
MSG|133| the driver damon said he picked me up and started my trip which is incorrect because im still standing at the airport. the driver just drove away
MSG|134| service animal was denied and driver rudely drove away
MSG|135| uber has really become a serious problem in chicago. nearly every time i try to get an uber for the airport on monday mornings (i do so every week) there is some sort of cancellation. but this week took it to new levels. i was assigned to jabal (license plate bg22624) who called me as soon as we were matched. he asked me to confirm my pickup address and asked where i was going. i said i was going to ohare and asked if that was a problem. he said no, and started heading towards me but was 8 minutes away. when he got close to my house, he proceeded to keep on driving past my place. after attempting to call him many times, i messaged him asking him to please cancel because i needed to get to the airport. he never responded and forced me to cancel. the most frustrating part was his dishonesty and the fact that he caused me to have to call a new lyft because it was also 8 minutes away. this caused me to almost miss my flight. my lyft driver was explaining that this is a very common problem in chicago on monday mornings. i know uber already refunded the cancellation, but this is beyond the $5. this driver should be punished for his schemey driving, what he did should not be acceptable. that could have cost me $350 if i missed my flight and arrived late to work. please make things better and restore my faith in uber.
MSG|136| my driver said he picked me up when he hadnt.
MSG|137| drunk and driving
MSG|138| the driver was under the influence and i could smell the liquor. me and other passenger was both complaining to driver he ignored us and proceeded to drive the same. he was eating tic tacs to get rid of the smell. the driver almost had 2 accidents with semi trucks because he was in the turning lane trying to proceed straight. i was scary the whole trip. uber you guys have to do better with choosing your drivers this is a continuous issue with this company and i continue to support you guys still this is ridiculous. i thank god i made it home safe to my children.
MSG|139| she was 10 minutes away and was taking to long u shouldn't have to pay because she was to far
MSG|140| dropped myself and another mid 20s female off in the middle of an intersection at 2am without question. even after i asked what he could do to help us.
MSG|141| i didnt cancel a trip. and got kicked out of the car. in the middle of brooklyn. at 2 am. despite my attempt at having a discussion with my driver regarding my safety.
MSG|142| i was picked up only to be driven to the wawa close to the point of origin, about half a mile away, where we went to fill up gas and it took him about 10 minutes between paying and pumping gas. i then realized i was behind schedule. at this point i cancelled the trip. please revise my cancellation fee as i was not responsible for the drivers lack of professionalism. thanks
MSG|143| the drivers trunk was full and refuse to move it to fit my luggage than refuse my trip.
MSG|144| hello. there are two charges ($5 from 5/3 and $5.28 5/2) on my corporate account that we're refunded as uber credits instead of being refunded on my credit card. please revise and refund the corporate card. one of these was due to your driver not being in the indicated location and other was due to the driver not driving towards my location. please reach out with questions to 347-604-0874
MSG|145| my driver drove very fast and never stopped the ride after he dropped me off so it over charged my card
MSG|146| i did not book this trip why am i being charged
MSG|147| someone else got in my car and left.
MSG|148| he never came and went to pick up someone else while having it as if he picked me up , thats why i canceled in the middle of the ride

MSG|150| driver picked up wrong passenger. i shouldnt be charged.
MSG|151| driver never showed, did not respond to attempt to communicate, and then i see in the app he put me in route! i was never in the car! i cancelled and it looks like you charged me for a partial trip? total fraud. he never showed up to pick me up.
MSG|152| i canceled the first time because i did not want the service, and the second time i did not want to walk.  i can not be charged for a service i did not use, and the driver did not have to drive.  i'm really tired of uber, every day is the same problem.  i want my money back

MSG|170| idk
MSG|171| i think my driver didnt add me as in the car but was still able to know my drop off location? when i got home, it was still telling me to walk towards him and apologizing for the trip taking so long. i pressed cancel to end the trip but i wan to make sure he gets paid for the trip.
MSG|172| i never took this ride at all pick up point for this ride is not even in the same state that i was in i never seen this driver or car why was i still charged?
MSG|173| it failed to allow me to update my trip. i made a mistake and put ny instead of dallas. still used same uber driver for correct location but app did not allow me to update my location. requesting a refund for the trip to ny as we didnt even leave my origination location before i changed it.
MSG|174| driver cancelled
MSG|175| hi the walking direction given by uber asked me to walk to was misleading. i crossed a parking lot and reached a fence with no road to turn on to. i was unable to reach my pick up location. subsequently, i had to call for a new uber ride.
MSG|176| i cancelled within 30 seconds of booking was confirmed.
MSG|177| driver started trip before picking me up !!! i never entered car please refund before i delete uber !
MSG|178| my driver refused to pick me up and asked me to cancel
MSG|179| my driver made an illegal u-turn right after picking me up and got pulled over. look at the location of where the ride ended. i was in the car for 1 minute and had to call another uber. please refund me in the entire amount.
MSG|180| driver drove passed me and he started the trip, i was never picked up and i tried calling him, and he didnt know where my pickup location was, i had to cancel on him and i called another uber ride, please provide refund please!
MSG|181| my driver pressed that he picked me up before he got to my pick up location. then the car didnt move towards me so i has to cancel and got a new one
MSG|182| driver was headed away from us extending wait time by many minutes. canceled to get closer uber
MSG|183| i got in the car and hit cancel by mistake. she made me get out of her car and get another uber. i dont want to pay any fee. she didnt drive anywhere but was parked the entire time.
MSG|184| driver was moving in the wrong direction and did not answer two phone calls
MSG|185| driver didnt show in pickup area and out of no where he started the trip , when i called him he declined and i texted him that where he is through the app but he texted me back on my phone number that he cannot talk right now
MSG|186| today when i tried booking your express pool service, i was assigned a pick up spot outside the pickup area shown while booking. i had to wait for 8-10 min instead of 5 min wait to find that i had to walk way further. this was a waste of my time. now when i asked for my refund you refund me in uber credit. please revert the refund back to my credit card.
MSG|187| i would like to be refunded for this as the driver called and was having car trouble and said he was going to take longer than the time stated on the app. please refund me the cancel fee
MSG|188| i had to cancel this trip because the driver marked me as having been picked up but i never even saw his car. then i saw on the gps that he was driving away but i could not order a new car without cancelling
MSG|189| he too longer then usual and he tried to pick me up after i cancelled your app wasn't allowed me to cancel n o been pushed cancel
MSG|190| i had to cancel several times because all of the drivers that i was offered were 15-16 minutes away. i kept reselecting, assuming that i would get a closer driver, but this last one that i cancelled was 16  minutes away from me. it was late at night and i had just arrive from the airport and i could not wait outside alone for 16 minutes to be picked up. i do not think it is fair that i was charged a $5 cancellation fee. 16 minutes is an unreasonable wait time, especially late at night for a young woman alone.
MSG|191| the driver picked up someone else instead of me for my route. she never came to my location
MSG|192| yeah i want a refund the uber drive said he picked me up and charged me and kept driving and i wasnt in the uber so now i had to canceled my ride nd im goin to be hour late to work and have to pay higher fees for my ride when i ordered on time
MSG|193| this ride was false ride. the app said that the driver had already pocked me up and in fact that was not true so i had to cancel in order to be able to take another uber.
MSG|194| my driver never arrived at the location to pick me up. even after sending a message and calling him.
MSG|195| the driver never arrived without picking me up driver changed the status to trip in progress
MSG|196| paypal account
MSG|197| this trip was inadvertently booked to a location in california from denver airport.  we remained in the same car and were able to obtain the same driver for the correct address.  youll see the trip with the same driver immediately thereafter.  can you please credit my account for the duplicate charge for the same ride given the error?.
MSG|198| i would like my cancellation fee money back i cancel this drive or seven times because i am a female i do not feel comfortable with driving with two males inside the car and if i cancel this driver more than five times perhaps you guys should not keep on sending me the same driver allowing the driver to except the ride
MSG|199| the driver cancelled for unknown reason. trip rebooked immediately with another driver.
MSG|200| i want to report this serious matter, when i met the driver i was opening the door but when the driver saw me he took off immediately. i dont why what was the reason behind this act i dont know if it was racist or what was the deal but i want to report this such act , he drove off while i was opening the door i almost fell
MSG|201| as i walked to this drive a car twice he pulled away finally he stopped about four houses away and when i got in i told him i was standing on the curb and he passed me up and i also said when i walk to your car you pulled off twice he said i think you should get another uber we're starting off on the wrong foot as i got out i slammed this store and he tried to run over me in front of my wife who was looking out of the door and god is my witness that's why i canceled his trip then when i called for the second over my wife decided cancel that trip to and i just took my vehicle to work i was so distraught that driver needs discipline if i wouldn't have jumped out of the way he would have ran me over it was so bad that my neighbors even came outside because of the screeching of his car
MSG|202| i am not paying for this trip. the driver was not the driver in the picture. there was also a communication barrier to clarify why he was not listed.
MSG|203| when i took this uber trip not to long ago my trip was extended and he was going the wrong way every buddies does the nation i got up at 12 when i said i was supposed be getting home at 11 and i got charged $31 i need this to be disputed
MSG|204| the driver kept going past pick up spot and kept driving around , took way to long
MSG|205| my group ordered two rides one on uber and one on lyft and this guy showed up on both apps and then left and did not cancel with me so we were stuck here waiting and watching his car drive away and leave me hanginf
MSG|206| trip started without being anywhere near my pickup location. so i canceled since i was not in the car.
MSG|207| the driver was still 10 minutes away but i was charged a fee. i needed to get my husband to work by 3. you had an uber that was 5 minutes away but then gave me one that was 11 minutes away. i shouldn't be charged this cancellation fee when they were far away and not close.
MSG|208| again, i expect not to be charged for any of these cancellation fees because time and time again i was matched with the same driver who caused me multiple problems. he made no effort to find me, was not coherently speaking, did not meet me where he told me to meet him twice, and i kept getting him when i tried to get another driver (even in a different spot). i used lyft cause this happened too much with a uber.
MSG|209| i waited for this driver for over 20-minutes i counseled him when i saw that it showed he had picked me up so i canceled
MSG|210| i was never in that car..
MSG|211| no. but i would like my cancellation fee refunded because i didnt feel safe getting in a car that was not register. ive wasted about 30 minutes trying to get a reliable uber today. what the hell is goin on!!!! i am just trying to get to my destination!!!
MSG|212| driver was not driving the car on profile and i didnt feel safe getting in a car that was not registered on uber. i should not be charged a cancellation fee!
MSG|213| i waited nearly 10 minutes for a pick up, and then i saw the driver fly past me then cancel the ride. i then needed to wait for another driver that would take another 5-10 minutes after completing another nearby trip. i should not be penalized for having to wait and then being cancelled on.
MSG|214| too long 20 min wait please refund me
MSG|215| the driver started the ride before he ever picked me up. check where the ride started vs where my pick up location was.
MSG|216| i waited for my uber driver at the location but we never found each other not
MSG|217| driver left me without any reason . i was charged and i would like to have my money refunded please
MSG|218| driver did not have his phone mounted on console. he had  phone in cup holder. not professional.\nhe was waiting for police to come. i just got off a 4 hrs plane ride. very tired. i called another uber.
MSG|219|21pm. her app showed us at 46th accurately while mine did not.
MSG|220| no
MSG|221| the driver called me an idiot!
MSG|222| my driver started this trip before ive even picked me up... i immediately cancelled when i saw that the trip started without me being in the car. i was charged twice for this same trip
MSG|223| i cancelled my trip and i didnt get charged a late fee but i didnt get my uber credits refunded from the trip
MSG|224| my driver was here and when i rode the car, he told me that he could not take me. so unprofessional!!! so i cancelled it right away!
MSG|225| my driver had another male occupant in the front passenger seat. i requested an uberx. when the driver pulled up i told the driver i did not request to have to people in the vehicle including himself. his response was its just my cousin. my mom just died and hes just riding with me. this situation made me feel unsafe to accept a ride from this driver. this action from the driver forced me to cancel the ride and request a new uber driver. this behavior is unacceptable from the driver since i did not request to have any other occupant in the vehicle besides the driver.
MSG|226| i was charged for the ride that i canceled
MSG|227| my driver didnt move towards my pickup  in fact he kept moving away and i know you guys saw that
MSG|228| my driver never picked me up.  i was extremely late and had to order a regular uber at much higher price so i dont want to pay for my next ride.
MSG|229| at the event
MSG|230| false shooting at rolling loud music festival. swat and police on site. driver could not reach me. i just want the cancellation fee back. i do not want credit.
MSG|231| uber driver picked up the wrong person. wothou valodating my name or number watched the uber driver drive padt me and rejected my lhone calles numerous times as i tried to call and tell him he had the wrong person. very unprofessional.
MSG|232| the driver told me to cancel the trip because he didnt want to wait for me at starbucks, then taking me to my other location.
MSG|233| submitted request, said 2 minutes away. waited almost 8 minutes at pickup spot, and the driver did not move towards us. attempted to contact driver, but he lied.
MSG|234| i dont know why i was charged $81.40 when my trip fare was $64.26.
MSG|235| driver dropped me off 10 blocks away from home
MSG|236| i ordered a ride and it was showing that he will arrive in 4 min but at first he was standing at the same place for maybe 10 min then i tried to call him few times but he didnt answer and then he drove away from wher he was standing for another 15 blocks
MSG|237| i was still charged 19.41 for this trip and i do not see a refund on my pending charges of my bank account. i was wondering why i havent gotten my refund when i havent taken this trip.
MSG|238| my driver never showed up, and had started the trip without picking me up
MSG|239| the driver didn't stop when he passed by us (we rose our phone and try to notify him)
MSG|240| i cancelled this ride because my driver did not move for 5 minutes.
MSG|241| driver was a complete asswipe
MSG|242| she couldnt take me to my destination please do not charge me for this
MSG|243| driver said the car is broken and he can not drive
MSG|244| driver said that car is broken
MSG|245| hey i just want to make sure there is. o negative impact to this driver. the one who came to pick me up before him literally pulled away fast & unsafely while my hand was on the door. she is lucky nobody was hurt. incredibly unprofessional and unbecoming of an uber driver
MSG|246| this driver picked up someone else and i couldn't find him and had to cancel
MSG|247| im not complaining about the girl that dropped me off tonight. the driver before her messaged me and asked where i was going. i sent my address and he cancelled my ride. this is not the first time this has happened. the gal that got me was great and i ended up getting her through lyft because of it. how can a driver message you and cancel a ride bc they dont want to go that route? that seems to defeat the point of using this app. i cant access his name. ive been using uber for years. this is the reason i downloaded lyft bc of the same incident. the driver called me and asked where i was going and said he didnt want to travel to plano. any thoughts on this ?
MSG|248| my driver never showed up but still took my trip, and when i texted him that you didnt pick me up why you still took my trip, but he didnt text me back and kept driving so i had to cancel the trip to be able to order another one. can you guys stop allowing drivers to do this kind of thing? its not the first time the driver taking my trip without picking me up
MSG|249| id like my money back, as i cancelled within time and cancelled because i didnt agree to walking. so cancelled. so please refund me. ty
MSG|250| its very frustrating when me and my family is waiting for a uber or i request a uber for a friend and the drivers cancel last min. i dont see why they pick up the trip if they dont want to drive to a certain neighborhood
MSG|251| driver called and said he was a few blocks away from my location waiting for me, but when i told him where i was, he sighed loudly on the phone, and spoke to me as if i, personally was an inconvenience for him. this was very confusing because i was at the designated pick-up point, and he was basically asking me to walk towards the place his last trip ended to save himself time (i waited for him to finish a trip). the location he was at was a very busy four-way intersection so its not easy to stop therei was waiting in a safer place.
MSG|252| driver never picked me up, just drove around in circles and never picked me up! even though he said he did! bullshit!
MSG|253| uber cash
MSG|254| he kept pulling over we asked to play some deferant music he said no and had his dog in the car.
MSG|255| give me my money back
MSG|256| on top of my driver being very very rude i accidentally selected the wrong stop which made him more frustrated! i am paying my money to ride comfortably not for my driver to have an attitude
MSG|257| my diver has been rude from the very begging i step foot into this car!! i refuse to pay 5$ for a 1 mins stop! and he told me he could cancel because it would ruin his bonus i am veryyy upset at this uber driver for being completely rude to me
MSG|258| this man never picked me up, it said he was a minute away and he turned around and then it said 3 minutes and then the ride started as if i was picked up and he never picked me up. im tired of being charged and having this same issue with uber. i want to be reimbursed, not uber credit
MSG|259| the ride was started with out me, and he never picked me up - he just drove right passed me... ban him!
MSG|260| i didn't even order this ride at all. i want my funds to be credited back into my account asap before i call corporate.
MSG|261| i can't reset password.  on friday 5/17 i ordered a ride from dallas love field, the instructions said to go down to area 4. that's where i went, but when the driver called me she said she was on the upper level and couldn't come to the lower level. i  cancelled the ride but was charged the whole amount. i don't think that's fair. it's not my fault your driver doesn't have the proper credentials to be at the airport. i ordered a second ride and it was great. i should not have to pay for mohammed, the first ride. and why would you charge for 2 rides going to the same place?
MSG|262| drivers eta was not accurate, ubers gps system was incorrect and the number jumped from 10 mins away to 21 mins away this required me cancel and request a new car as it would have made me late for work. i tried to call the driver but nobody picked up, please refund.
MSG|263| i was charged a $3 cancellation fee again
MSG|264| my driver was too far
MSG|265| my driver kept calling me asking me where i was even though i didnt leave from the location that i called for the uber from. it was very confusing and he made it seem like i had done sometbing wrong. eventually i had to cancel because of timing.
MSG|266| he was making wrong weird turns and was supposed to be here 2 minutes before i cancelled and then he was still 4 min away! i have to go! i dont have time to wait around
MSG|267| no
MSG|268| this driver accept my request and sifon like she picked me up but she did not!! my uber map start to showing me my route but i was not in the car??? so please dont give a credit those lier drivers and please do some serious investigation. pay my money back!
MSG|269| the driver never showed up...tried to contact multiple times no response. i couldnt wait anymore. so booked again immediately. please refund the cancellation fee
MSG|270| i waited 10min for a supposed 5 min eta and the driver just stopped across the street, marked the ride as started and drove past me. then when he was all the way down the street cancelled it. now i have to wait another 10min for another more expensive uber with an ice cream cake.
MSG|271| car and plate not match the photo in the app and you charge me five dollars i need refund
MSG|272| driver showed and said he couldnt take our party. we had 6 the same amount we had on the way over!
MSG|273| this is unacceptable
MSG|274| he was an asshole he cursed me out infront of people and blamed uber pool for not being on the spot you guys should take him off of uber
MSG|275| i never purchased the order and you guys never gave me back the money to my bank account and i dont use the uber app at all so theres no point on giving me credit for the app i just want my $28 that uber owes me because i never used the ride
MSG|276| not that i know of
MSG|277| i have not been able to book a trip n it ysed my promo without me even using a trip
MSG|278| i would  like my funds to go back to my account
MSG|279| told her i needed the other uber driver and asked her to cancel and she said i keep picking the wrong car but i am going to pick up food and her car has signs saying no food allowed so i kept canceling her rides
MSG|280| the driver never showed up so i had to take a shuttle even after i called him
MSG|281| to whom this may concern, we ordered an uber to pick us up at 330. the driver, deandre, accepted our ride but never moved or headed our way. we were on our way to the airport. he never came. we could not order another ride because deandre did not cancel our ride and we did not want to incur the $5 fee. we waited for deandre for 45 minutes before we ordered a lyft. i am disappointed in his service and your policy. i understand why they are in place but this is not our fault. thank you. dr. shaileen araki.
MSG|282|57.  also i had the same driver when i needed to request another ride.
MSG|283| i wad waiting for this driver and it said he was 8 min away. i noticed him driving away on the app from where he was supposed to pick me up from.  then he was 13 minutes away, then 14 minutes away, and then 16 minutes away. he drove completely in a different direction and i think he did that so that i would cancel the trip he basically left me stranded in a bad area.
MSG|284| this guy literally saw me was on a green light i was waiting for him to pull up on the corner dude literally speed off what is going on with this uber man your people are super rude and unprofessional
MSG|285| i thought gold members can re book within 15 mins and the prior cancellation would be wav
MSG|286| driver pulled away as i was approaching vehicle like a scam attempt.
MSG|287| my driver told me he couldnt take me and my partner because it was 2 of us.. i did not understand it at all because why would he tell us that! and i tried requesting another rider but it kept connecting the same driver. i dont think i should be charged for canceling!
MSG|288| it was my first time using uber. i set up a pick up of my elderly parents to take them to the airport. my dad is 90 years old and my mom is 82 diagnosed with cancer. i set up the ride ahead of time on tuesday, may 7th for 12pm thursday may 9th. the driver never showed up. luckily they had a family friend there to help them an arrange another ride. they can not do it themselves since they only have a flip phone. thankfully there was someone there to help them. this was upsetting since i was not there.
MSG|289| erica the driver on this after she was assigned to me texted me to tell me she had a flat tire and she would have to cancel me. the only way i was to close out and request another driver to take us to the airport was to cancel that ride first. then i received an $8.17 receipt from you. please refund this charge.
MSG|290| the app switched address from 210 union ave to 210 union st which was incorrect pick up
MSG|291| the estimate of arrival of the driver was 6 while the estimate of actually getting to the destination was 10! i didnt think these two number quite align with each other and i was in a hurry. so it didnt make sense to wait that long for the driver to arrive
MSG|292| disputing this cancellation fee. the app made it appear i was already pricked up, but the vehicle had not arrived yet.
MSG|293| i never took this ride nor committed to it. my actual trip was in a different car with different driver.
MSG|294| fighting with passenger. twice made a dangerous turns.
MSG|295| my driver wasnt moving toward me and neither was the time to pick up.
MSG|296| the driver is too far. i want to get a refund.
MSG|297| why cant i book a ride! the app says no cars available. but the fare was taken from my account. is there a problem for the reason i cant get a ride. this is inconvenient
MSG|298| i was incorrectly charged for this. on the map, it appeared the same driver was already driving away from me. i cancelled and called a new one right away and it turned out to be the same driver anyway.
MSG|299| the driver does not speak any english. you should not hire people who are unable to communicate - what if there is an accident or a situation that requires them to communicate their location or the situation? they wont be able to!
MSG|300| we had a 3 hour drive from sfo airport to fresno. 10 minutes into the trip the driver decided he could take us any more so we had to get a new uber driver
MSG|301| i'm pissed at this system right now. apparently you guys took my 5 dollar uber cash for a ride that never even got to me or messaged me. he accepted the ride out in livermore before even driving to my house and picking me up. i need those credits back and my 2.60 from my card
MSG|302| the app made the driver go to my dropoff location instead of my pickup.
MSG|303| longer than expected and not answering call
MSG|304| the car never arrived to the pick up point for over 20 minutes and i had to cancel. but im being charged an outrageous amount for a trip i didnt take
MSG|305| thanks.
MSG|306| my driver never showed, i called multiple times an he didnt answer i had to cancel my ride an still got charged. he never showed up or answered
MSG|307| the driver could not understand the use of the app and told us he was at the arrival address and not the pick up address. the app showed his car near the pickup address but it took more than 10 minutes for him to start heading our way so we canceled
MSG|308| my bank statement says its been charged twice for this trip
MSG|309| this driver went to the wrong address and would come to my locate. please refund.
MSG|310| i just looked in this app to see if uber was work yet. i had $20.89 now o have $7.39 something iber is robben now! i'm bail inn enforcement i will contact who i need to contact if this money don't go back i haven't not used this service weeks because nothing works the truth show this as well last trip was a benz jeep which was wrong and guy charged his picture do not play with me about this!!
MSG|311| i was charged for a cancellation fee for my other trip even though my driver wasnt moving and a waited a good amount of time. i want to be refunded for that or credited for this trip.
MSG|312| see above.
MSG|313| silver volkswagen jetta
MSG|314| i attempted to call my driver. he did not pickup. he circled the location. three times, never turning onto my street. i waited 10 minutes. im not sure what i was supposed to de except cancel. i dont believe a 5 dollar fee is fair. id appreciate someone reviewing the charge
MSG|315| i didn't even get on the car. driver didn't picked me up and fled away. i had to call another uber right after
MSG|316| my driver never picked me up
MSG|317| the driver cancelled the trip. please refund the fee.
MSG|318| pickup location was wrong, driver didnt come
MSG|319| during my trip i realized that i had an emergency at home and needed to go back immediately. i asked my driver to turn around, he did not understand english and continued driving. he continued driving for about 10 minutes while i tried to communicate to him that i had an emergency and needed to return home. he finally pulled over. when he did he called uber and argued with someone in spanish for another 5-10 minutes. after he got off the phone i asked him to please bring me home but he kept repeating something i did not understand. he then put something that wasnt my address in his gps and began driving. i then asked him to stop and got out of the car. \ni was left standing on the side of route 146n for 25 minutes while i waited for a new uber.\n\nthis experience was terrifying and dangerous. i am requesting a full refund of the $34.11 that i was charged for that trip. it was absolutely unacceptable and unsafe. im questioning whether i will ever travel with uber again.
MSG|320| i was charged 2 cancellation fees due to me trying to get a ride and uber app wasnt not connecting me to a driver. twice
MSG|321| i requested my uber he was taking twice the amount of the the estimated time and i tried to call and message him repeatedly and he wouldn't pick up his phone or respond
MSG|322| driver took to long and driving away, requested another uber
MSG|323|55am and the driver did not show up in time
MSG|324| the app updated its route after i had walked to the pickup spot and had been waiting 5 min. when it updated, i was no longer a pickup on the route, but was still ending at my apt. i called the uber driver to confirm that i was going to be picked up and he said i wasnt and to cancel because i wouldnt be charged. so i did and had to wait for another car.
MSG|325| wrong pick-up location
MSG|326| went from 8 to 13 minutes didnt move at all
MSG|327| i want the next ride i took refunded because i was using commuter benefits card - and this guy kept driving the wrong direction til i had no choice but to pay using my own card.
MSG|328| my driver originally said 3 minutes. then it jumped to 10 minutes
MSG|329| the driver canceled my trip with 1.27 to arrival tim
MSG|330| hello!  can a manager please contact me i am extremely disappointed with a scheduled pickup i had this morning
MSG|331| i did not take this trip the uber driver never picked me up
MSG|332| i was never picked up to begin with. yet, the driver had me as in the car. i shouldnt be charged any cancellation fees, i called the driver and it didnt help.
MSG|333| rude would not accept ride. would not cancel i dont want to be charged
MSG|334| his license plate did not match the app.  i took a photo and it was cjd3021.  when i confronted him, he admitted that he changed the license plate.  following safety protocol i did not get in the car.  if he was able to give me a bad rating i would like to vehemently protest it.  how do i find out if he rated me?  i would hope that you would not allow this driver to rate me, and also given that you are advising every passenger to check the license plate, that this driver explain why his license plate does not match his profile.
MSG|335| she was so slow and she can't find another co rider easily.she wasted my money & time.
MSG|336| i want my money back.she was too slow .she waste my time .she picked up wrong location to co rider
MSG|337| this lady accepts my ride and she never pick me up at all so i need me a refund
MSG|338| he never moved for 5-10 minutes
MSG|339| the driver kept going further from the pick up location and it reflects as if she was detouring some where else
MSG|340| the driver started the ride, but he had not picked me up. so i cancelled the trip and requested another trip, where the same driver picked me up. the driver claimed that the app glitches and he accidentally started the trip without me in the car. please refund me.
MSG|341| my driver turned and started driving in the other direction and the wait time started to reverse. i have a screen shot to share.
MSG|342| he never even picked us up, i called twice and he never answered the phone and was not located at our location. i saw he clicked that we got in the car when we never entered it and now have to order another one. incredibly unprofessional and unsafe
MSG|343| my driver and i could not connect.  please refund my cancellation fee
MSG|344| trip included multiple stop seemed not to go in the correct way, tried to cancel and put stops in correctly. did not work. the driver should be paid. the $29.85. it was taking from my bank account
MSG|345| my driver when matched was 1 minute away. he ended up driving away from me. by the time i had to cancel, he didnt respond to my message, he was more than half way to my destination. i should not be charged a cancellation. i would have been waiting forever. also the app should not allow an estimate of pick time more than quadrupled and never decrease and not matching the rider with a new driver.
MSG|346| i would like a refund that is being charged on my credit card. i didnt take this car.
MSG|347| []
MSG|348| i am allergic to cologne and air fresheners. i texted this to the driver. when i got in the car i  didnt realize he or the car had fragrance. i started smell it after a couple of blocks and opened the windows.    the driver advised me to cancel because it was a long trip
MSG|349| my eta said 1 min when the app said 5 min walk to destination and the car gps on the app keeps spinning the car. i want a refund.
MSG|350| my uber driver was 10 minutes away and was not making any progress towards my location which is why i cancelled. i should not be charged a cancelation fee for not wanting to wait extra time on an uber to make his way towards my location.
MSG|351| my account was charged twice for 10 dollars but i cancelled it for five
MSG|352| the driver accepts my trips but he doesnt seems like to come n i called him he just refuse to answer thats was so bad
MSG|353| i got a back problem and i need to seat on the front seat but driver refused and bad attitude. so cancel my trip.
MSG|354| i ordered this uber, i never got in it and the driver had put i got in the car. i was unfairly charged for a ride i didnt even take .
MSG|355| uber driver continue the drive after been dropped off
MSG|356| i wanted to complain about this driver yesterday but i lost my phone for 1 when he got me everything was cool then on the way to get the second co rider he almost side swiped a car then the second person gets in he cuts off a car with no signal we get to the second person  and as he driving he gets a third he tells  the second person  to get out when it was the third person pick up so now we waited passed the 2 mins he is allowed me and the 2nd girl is getting upset because the 3rd isn't there  yet . this whole trip was bad the driver was rude the driving was bad the 3rd corider was rude just bad experience
MSG|357| hi can i get a refund driver and i couldnt connect
MSG|358| i called him and told him that the app doesnt have my correct pick up location and ill sms my location to him i did and he drove right by me my boyfriend called and told him to turn around he did and went into a street and took forever to come out i missed my flight and had to rebook for the next day
MSG|359| uber did not show up. i do not expect to pay this fare. thank you.
MSG|360| my driver asked me to cancel the trip because he was stuck in traffic and i have evidence of the messages he sent me.
MSG|361| false
MSG|362| i didnt take this trip plus it was cancelled on my uber trip but the money still come out my bank account i need that  money back
MSG|363| the driver called me names and said he would find me and hurt me
MSG|364| would like my fare of $21.27 fully refunded.
MSG|365|15 am which i absolutely cannot miss. i waited a while and it is raining outside. i have to cancel as the driver was not moving at all. thats why i requested a full refund to my credit card. instead, i had to run in the rain and get a subway. please help with this issue.
MSG|366| i think the driver picked someone else up.  when i tried to contact them, they didnt respond.  so i cancelled without ever seeing him
MSG|367| he was really really rude, i asked if he is coming, he says you only wait for 3mins, i told him i have been waiting for more than 7mins, he hang up my phone.,  so i have to cancel and call another uber. very unprofessional and very rude
MSG|368| he took certainly way to long. i would like my refund. it said 7 minutes. i was waiting for 20 minutes. so i cancelled the ride.
MSG|369| i was unfairly charged a cancellation fee and i am upset because the driver never showed up but uet i got charged twice once for pick up and rhen for cancellation its lije he got paid to do nothing\n\nvery upsetting
MSG|370| when we seated inside the car driver app lost signal and he restarted his phone . after he turned his phone on it was showing that he has no rider in his car , his app was looking to find ride for him and he ask me to cancel because he had no other option that is why i cancel but during that time he was slowly moving and waiting for his phone to restart and he pulled over cross street so this trip never happened
MSG|371| hi there. i am a long-time uber customer with a very reliable history and reading. when i landed at lax today i called in huber pool which asked me to wait five minutes so that i could match with the driver. after five minutes nothing happened and it sent me back to the original landing page. this proceeded to happen to more times and i spent over 20 minutes simply trying to call an uber home. i ended up having to take a taxi cab which cost me over $50. after this experience i feel as if uber wasted not only my time but my money also. i would have taken lyft, but i have not downloaded it because i have always preferred uber but after this experience i might half to use lyft going forward. if there is any thing you could do such as reviewing my ride history to verify my story in the amount of time i spent simply trying to call an uber i would appreciate it.
MSG|372| ride was cancelled immediately
MSG|373| the driver did not come to the pick up location and he just indicated that he picked me up when i wasnt even in the car. i dont think i should be paying for a ride that i didnt even get
MSG|374| my driver called me to ask about my destination. after i told him that we are going back to sf he just disconnected his phone and cancelled the ride. this is not the level of service i expect.
MSG|375| how dare you charge me  for a driver who didnt show up!!!! i had a doctor appt and had to call an uber. refund me now!!! and i paid you $14.00 ! month for better treatment.  cancel my subscription.
MSG|376| ok so i ordered ride. the driver arrived and i got in his truck.  he said he had to cancel because it was too far. this is after he had accepted the trip. when i asked why he said because i did not state how far i was going. i told him he should know since it appears on his phone. he was very rude and asked me to get out. i have never been treated so rude. so i dont think i should have to pay anything since he was the one who said he couldn't take me. i was already inside his truck.  i really hope he was not being homophobic.  i am a television talk show host in houston and a news reporter visiting california for work. this man needs to not be an uber driver if he is going to be doing that to customers.
MSG|377| i accidentally was on the wrong level of the airport and the driver was yelling at me on the phone for being wrong and i said, i am coming upstairs right now. i apologize. please dont be rude and he said, ya know what i dont appreciate your attitude, and i said i just misunderstood the directions. i dont use uber very often. i see your car. i am walking to you now and he said, okay and drove off once i was near the car. i understand the right to refuse service but it was very intense and unnecessary. he had great reviews and i believe he felt that i was being rude which is what prompted his unprofessional actions, but i think he should have been a little bit more patient. it was a simple misunderstanding and a lack of ability to hear him clearly through the phone.
MSG|378| yelled and drove crazy
MSG|379| i do not like to complain about any driver, i appreciate them always, but this driver's age i felt made the pick up time alot longer then necessary and he could not hear me .
MSG|380| had to cancel to get another driver wait time stated 5 minutes called driver was told he needed 15 minutes to get to my location.
MSG|381| to know why i woke up to 3 different charges from uber. you guys already take pre-authorized payments for my account so nothing else should have been taken especially when i hadn't taken a ride since 12 a.m. these charges appeared at 9 and 10 a.m. i didn't take her eyes it doesn't show up on my trips so why the f*** are you taking my money
MSG|382| this driver (billy) accepted my fare, did not cancel and would not pick up the phone (i called him repeatedly to get an update on timing / location). i waited a good 10-15 mins before i had to cancel and order a replacement car.  this was inconsiderate and unprofessional behavior
MSG|383| my driver stopped across the street away from my pickup spot. i finally noticed his flashing lights. i waited for the light to turn green so that i can cross and he just sped off. he wasnt at my designated pick up area that i marked on my map. so i had to cancel since he didnt communicate with me why he was leaving. i called another car that is arriving.
MSG|384| they took the full amount for my ride even though i canceled the trip and i was stuck and late to work
MSG|385| 
MSG|386| driver literally didn't move according to app. restarted phone and refreshed network connection to be sure. have to be at work at 830 so cant risk and had to cancel.
MSG|387| when will i receive my refund
MSG|388| driver picked up a wrong person and then was not able to speak english to communicate. hence, i cancelled the ride and booked a new one but i dont know how will i receive the refund?
MSG|389|02am from the same scam artist driver. this driver started my trip the moment he took the ride. i was never in the car. i called to find him and he never answers his phone only texting me that there would be a $150 cancel fee. this is a lie and made me feel unsafe. i was not getting in the car with him. totally unacceptable!! i had no choice but to cancel the ride to get another driver and i got him again and he did the exact same thing to me. he is a scam artist and if both of these charges are not removed immediately i will be disputing with my credit card company. fire that driver he really made getting home last night difficult for me and im angry about all of this.
MSG|390| yes the driver was by my house to pick me up and drive in the opposite way to come pick me which just made me late work
MSG|391| the driver never picked us up, but somehow the ride started.  he was going towards our destination and not coming back so i cancelled and got a new driver.  htung came and picked us up and got us to the hilton.
MSG|392| driver got lost and accused us of moving.  said hes from san diego and so couldnt accept directions to destination.  seemed confused entering destination in gps.
MSG|393| i had to cancel my ride because the drivers app wasn't working and she didn't have directions. so i had to call another uber and i was charged a $5 cancellation fee
MSG|394| i did not take this trip
MSG|395| as i was walking towards where my driver was i waved at him to let him know i was his uber ride. i was about to open the car door when he sped up and drove away. i saw that he also had a passenger in his car. i dont remember opting for uber pool and quite friendly i felt extremely offended. never in my history of ubering has this ever happened it was very dangerous also how he sped up while i was reaching for the car door. this is absolutely unacceptable
MSG|396| i waited at the pick up point.  driver never showed and shows it was canceled by driver but her i was still charged.
MSG|397| driver made us enter two locations which doubles the price and then he lied and said he fixed the app and the after complaining he made us get out of the uber and wouldnt drive us any further
MSG|398| he picked up the wrong person, then didnt cancel the route for a while. which led to a charge. he wouldnt pick up my calls
MSG|399| jesus drove past me and went to the wrong pickup location. he then started circling and not coming toward me at all. i tried calling and he did not pick up. the whole experience was ridiculous. im in a lyft now.
MSG|400|30am in the morning i had to wait because he did not do his job. i had other options but since he accepted i sent them on. terrible service.
MSG|401| he drove off as i got to the car .. like a bitch...
MSG|402| i gave him instructions on how to bypass construction which he ignored, and then when i called he was aggravated about not being able to find me so i offered to cancel and he gave me attitude. not acceptable
MSG|403| driver picked up the wrong passenger right in front of me. should not be charged for cancellation. had to cancel after he picked up wrong passenger and drove away. called him. he did not answer phone.
MSG|404| on my last trip i waited for 20 minutes, and marcel the driver didn't show up. he was going the opposite direction. i texted him and asked him why he's going the wrong direction and he didn't respond. after 20 mins and being late for work i used lyft to get to work.\neventhough i i got a 5 dollar credit back, id like to report marcel s unprofessional behavior for wasting people's time. he was only three minutes away from my location and perhaps decided to take a different passenger with a different app, while making me wait.
MSG|405| driver kept going the wrong way
MSG|406| i received a text from my driver stating that he had arrived but i was not able to locate in the designated pick-up area. i thought i saw a car fitting the correct description, drive away and i text him to confirm this. next i heard a man yelling my name, but he was behind me and behind a gate in an area that was not approved for passenger pick-up (this was jfk airport).  i confirmed my identity and he gestured for me to cross the walk to the car. but instead of helping me with my bag he immediately began berating me of accusing him for driving off. i recanted my mistake and asked if we could leave since traffic was about to get bad. but his response was to question the names on my account and tell me that i delayed him due to missing a person. then he told me to catch another car, but that he would not cancel the trip. i understand that everyone has bad days and timeliness is always important; i too am a business owner and do i try to be conscious of these things. but there was absolutely no reason for him to raise his voice to such levels or address me with such disrespect, not just as a customer but as a fellow human. his aggressive behavior was such that after the incident, a couple walked over to ask me if i was okay. my fianc and i share this uber account and i do feel that if i was a man, he would not have addressed me in this way. he is also physically much larger than myself and for a moment i felt completely unsafe and overpowered. this incident is unacceptable in every way, all stemming from this drivers decision to pick-up from a location that was adjacent to the indicated pick up area. \n\nthank you for reviewing this message. i hope that no other customer will be made to feel the way i was today, by any uber driver.
MSG|407| my uber driver did not pick me up and began the trip as if they did.
MSG|408| i was waiting a while and didnt feel safe standing on the street alone so i got into a cab that was coming down the street instead to avoid standing alone in the dark.
MSG|409| driver didn't pick me up at my pick up spot then called me to ask my to walk multiple blocks to his car. this wasn't even a pool
MSG|410| the driver was driving away. the first time i cancelled and the second time i requested it was the same driver so i cancelled. why should i be charged of the cancellation fee?
MSG|411| hey i cant take an ive bc and advertisement something wrong. what is happening with my app?
MSG|412| this fee specifically
MSG|413| it said 11 mins and its over 11 mins and hes still picking up 2 people. i understand being late a few minutes but 12 mins after it said 11 minutes and hes still going in circles picking up 2 riders while i wait on the rain is not fair!
MSG|414| my driver wasn't coming towards me
MSG|415| i request for uber which is i am not is car and he start trip then he end the trip which is i was not there uber charge me 9$ something does not make sense please refund my money he should not start my teip unless i am not there thanx that time i was in rush thats why i did not report driver show respact
MSG|416| pickup location incorrect
MSG|417| this driver refused to come to my destination which was level 1 of the pickup area and he told me to cancel. he refused to cancel the trip himself. this was a waste of my time and i want my money back
MSG|418| the driver refused my destination and then refused to cancel because he didnt want to get a negative rating.
MSG|419| no i want my fucking 5 dollars back that driver made me late for work fuck the credit i want the cash she accepted the trip and never moved to get get the cancellation money
