MSG|1008| hello. i selected the pool selection. after i ordered my trip i saw that my trip included walking as well. i was under the impression that the ride sharing that included the walking was a different selection. i use uber all the time but usually ride uber x. i was charged three dollars for my cancelation fee hut i can not walk. the time frame for my trip would of taken more than 30 minutes and i thought that eas quite a while i would be walking. i just had surgery amd i have in drains attached tp my body and cant be walking that much. please help me
MSG|1009| he never picked me up !
MSG|1010| waited at the pickup zone and was not able to get driver to stop for me. i had given my specific location many times.
MSG|1011| i would my money back on my card same place you guys took it from in the beginning not credited back to my account . no one has money to just sit around and waste , thats an unfair option! you dont know it that was my last or not!
MSG|1012| no
MSG|1013| my driver said he picked me up in the app, when he never did so i would be forced to cancel. he ignored my messages that i was waiting and i had to cancel and then call a more expensive uber to get to where i needed to be on time.
MSG|1014| he took longer than expected and i was running very late so had to hail a cab.
MSG|1015| i chose this subject because i didnt know where to put my issue. mohammed never picked me up. he didnt answer any of my calls or my text messages. it is very dark and i am a single woman with very little knowledge of nj. i dont want to be charged a cancellation fee nor this fare. please honor my request as the driver did not respond.
MSG|1016| driver refused to verify his name at pickup. \ngot mad when i asked him to do so. he stated. oh no. drove away. this is a red flag. dangerous situation. this driver should be removed from driving for uber or lyft
MSG|1017| it started raining really bad. i had to cancel to get a regular uber pool can you please help?
MSG|1018| the driver started my trip before i could even find him. when he did call i was screamed at. i use uber every weekend and should not be treated like this
MSG|1019| my driver did not finish the trip when he dropped us off. i was charged $78 for him to drive home. i would like a refund and someone to call me back. other than that the driver was great.
MSG|1020| just wanted to let you know this guy wasted my time by not taking me after waiting for 5+ mins
MSG|1021| this was reported in error. the driver never picked me up
MSG|1022| hi, i got in this car and the driver stated that he couldnt take me so we had to get out because of some issue with the destination location on the app. sorry for the typos, this app doesnt let me scroll to correct what im typing. thanks         some issue
MSG|1023| hi there, would you mind send me my business monthly travel report for april?
MSG|1024| my driver did not arrive within expected time. please help me with a full refund. thank you
MSG|1025| i paid for the ride and the cancellation fee, i want my refund from the trip, my card was already charged.
MSG|1026| the driver wasnt able to get the trip, he never carriage me to the destination. he was at the place that he was suppose to pick me up and he didnt move
MSG|1027| didnt want to take me
MSG|1028| this driver did not speak english and never came to pick me up. i canceled the trip after waiting for 20 mins for him to arrive. i was them charged for the cancellation fee. i was late for work because of this.
MSG|1029| whem i cancelled and re dud the trip bc he never showed up. it is sending the same driver agter he asked me to vancel please give me my cancellatiom fee back. this makes no sens he didnt soeak english and daud he didnt understand what i ead saying
MSG|1030| he said my tummy hurts i wont be there for\n30- minutes why would anyone accept that? he should not take fares if he is not physically able to
MSG|1031| the address details on my app was not matching the drivers app. so i had to cancel the trip and book a new trip.
MSG|1032| this and the other 3 cancelation charges needs to be reviewed. i have been an active customer for a while now and u would like to stay using this company. the driver wesley t731877c was just a block away from me when i requested pool, all he had to do was make a right to pick me up at the location uber had me wait on. he failed to do so twice , after the first time i called him and he was yelling and very rude. after the second attempt at trying to pick me up he did the exact same thing so i called him. again he was rude and yelling saying that he cant find the ups store where i was waiting. after 15 minutes i had to cancel and try and find a different driver. i repeated this 4 times and kept getting this same incompetent driver i was furious . at my inconvenience i was forced to leave the errand for a later time and take the train to work as i was now almost late.
MSG|1033| he never came and got me he put i was in car and i never was
MSG|1034| i have two cedit cards on my account. the first card is for business travel. i used that payment method by accident. i want to use the other card for this trip.
MSG|1035| my driver said it was 15 mins away and i found a ride that was a shorter time. i still had the time to cancel
MSG|1036| the area made it hard for reception i could not see where the uber ride
MSG|1037| wrong destination
MSG|1038| the app kept saying there will be a fee when i was accepting the ride. i dont know what was going on i ended up with the same driver so it's not cancelled. i do not want a cancellation fee when i am taking the ride
MSG|1039| the driver never arrived
MSG|1040| her car overheated and i had to get out and find another uber
MSG|1041| my uber driver was completely professional and very kind. his app was acting up and wasnt processing/accepting once i got into the cab. i then had him pullover and re-order but his phone/app wasnt working so he couldnt take me to my location. it is not my fault for this charge.
MSG|1042| the driver drove right by us at the same location and check that we where in the car! pleas refund my money ana what seems to be the problem his now the third ride and im goin far!
MSG|1043| my driver drove past me twice and never stopped and never answered my call
MSG|1044| i  cancelled this trip due to the driver taking a very long time more than 10 minutes late. i need a refund from this cancellation fee!
MSG|1045| i couldnt find my driver. i called and no answer. i ordered a different uber immediately. please refund cancellation fee
MSG|1046| asking cash
MSG|1047| i dont know why you all felt the need to charge me after i cancelled the trip in less than a minute. i know as a driver for uber the potential rider has a very short window that he or she is able to cancel in. to charge me after i cancelled immediately is a little irritating when i know it didnt cost the driver anything except for knowing that he didnt get a rider. please take a look at this more in-depth
MSG|1048| i was never picked up from my pick up spot and my ride began.
MSG|1049| the driver never showed up. i called 2x and texted him to no response even tho he said he had arrived at the pick up.
MSG|1050| my driver never picked me up and yet began the trip, drove away and refused to cancel. please refund the trip $
MSG|1051| my driver picked up the wrong person. i just want to make sure i get my money back.
MSG|1052| my driver lost your ride and i need pick again
MSG|1053| he wasnt at the correct pickup location, blamed me, and never bothered to drive to me after i clarified with him. he drove the opposite direction and never notified me, forcing me to cancel and pay the fee to even get a new ride
MSG|1054| this driver claimed to pick me up and started the trip, but i was never in their vehicle
MSG|1055| im so livid. ive been waiting for my ride for 15 minutes when it said it was 2 minutes away. and now i have to call and wait another 5 minutes to get a driver and im going to be home way later than expected. i expect to be compensated this is unacceptable.
MSG|1056| i selected uberpool. my driver picked up a person before me a few blocks away and then he selected on the app to show i was picked up and on my way to my destination when i was not even in the car. he drove past me and wouldnt cancel my ride. i tried calling him and texting him through the app and he ignored both. i was forced to cancel and request another uber. i was standing at the designated pick up spot as well. he selected i was in the car even though he was blocks away! i then saw him drive by me and not stop and head onto the freeway. i have screenshots of me trying to contact the driver,  how it showed he kept driving even though i wasent in the car, and screenshots of me requesting another uber immediately after. please refund the cancellation fee and file a complaint against the driver. thank you.
MSG|1057| the driver accepted the ride and never showed up or picked me up. i called her multiple times and she hang up on me on multiple occasions. trip never happened. please provide full return.
MSG|1058| sent a message to driver giving him directions to location. as i saw him pull up i walked out of the entrance of my building to meet him. saw him look me dead in the eyes and keep driving all the way to the northern part of our complex. i then gave him a call to tell him to turn around and that i was the first building he passed, he was irate and didnt even acknowledge what i had just said. rudely said that he didnt see anyone outside the first building. this driver has been the most rude person ive yet to meet riding with uber. strictly unprofessional. his rudeness was the reason for my cancellation. and my trust riding with uber in the future shaken.
MSG|1059| i scheduled a pick up and it was cancelled without notice- twice.
MSG|1060| my driver picked up wrong person, i had to cancel
MSG|1061| im wondering why i was charged $8.68 for a trip i didnt take? the receipt is saying i rode in the car for .04 miles (2 min). this is incorrect. i never rode in this car and i dont understand why im being charged like i had.
MSG|1062|55. and i was sent all the way across the city
MSG|1063| i never took this ride and it's coming up on my bank account as being charged for it ..
MSG|1064| you guys charged me for the ride but the uber driver was not moving towards me.
MSG|1065| i want to cancel the fee because the driver picked up the wrong person
MSG|1066| please call me
MSG|1067| kenza never showed up to pick me up. the route was updated and continued without me as i tracked it while waiting for her.
MSG|1068| i was walking to the pickup spot, and about a block away the uber app switched to showing me on the trip already. i was not at the pickup spot or in a car when that happened. when i pushed to cancel so i could call a car and actually get to my destination it said that i was on the trip and would be charged accordingly. i had to rebook and pay again to actually get where i was going so i'm requesting this fee is removed
MSG|1069| i requested a ride and my app was showing my ride around 4 minutes away and then it showed as if i was already picked up. i messaged the driver and he said he didnt realize that it said he picked up a passenger and that his app had been messing up all day and he told me to cancel it and request another ride
MSG|1070| my driver was extremely rude and ready to quick us out the vehicle. we were trying to input our return on the trip and he wouldnt allow us too. he refused to deliver us even with us inputting it in the app. we all (my friends and i) felt very uncomfortable with the driver malik.
MSG|1071| i was waiting for my driver, saw he canceled and im being charged
MSG|1072| my driver purposely went to opposite direction!!
MSG|1073| an unable to reach you guys to argue like cancellation fees my driver was going to the wrong address what do you want me to do charged me 350 the whole trip
MSG|1074| the driver was 7 minutes away, i waited 5 minutes and checked and he was still in the same spot. why am i getting charged for this? thank you!!
MSG|1075| driver never showed up and said on the app that i was on my way home.
MSG|1076| i need to be at the airport and it said he would be here in 8 minutes. then it went up to 16 minutes this would have made us late for our flight.
MSG|1077| hi there -- i am extremely disappointed with how uber has handles issues where the driver cancels a ride.    ps -- this issue isn't to do with rafael, but to do with omar -- the driver who canceled my request.  to give you an insight into what happened, i requested a pool ride from ashbury street, and after a harrowing  minute wait, i'm told that i have to walk over to the pick-up spot about 3 minutes away. so i get to the pickup spot and see omar in the black honda, proceed to call him -- but he disconnects my call, and goes ahead and cancels my ride?   i'm then matched with another driver who's 9 minutes away -- this is too long of a wait for me, after having already waited 11 mins by now for this crazy driver. so i  cancel my ride --- i'm then charged a $3 cancellation fee, and then i have to book a regular uber at twice the price, and funnily enough he arrives in less than a minute after i've booked..... is this a ploy by uber to irritate customers trying to use the pool service by making it so user unfriendly, and absolutely ridiculous to use? a ride which should've cost me $6 ended up costing me $12 + $3 + 3 mins instead of the 8 minutes it should've taken for the ride!  disgusting!
MSG|1078| hi there  there is no way to contact uber about drives that are cancelled by drivers. \n\ntoday, i requested a pick up from prime detailing on ashbury street and i was asked to walk 3 minutes to a pick up spot. i got there and saw my driver omar in a black honda, who cancelled my ride as i got there. \n\nabsolutely disgusted by this behaviour!
MSG|1079| hi, \n\nthe driver called me after he missed an entrance to my street and said that i would have to cancel my ride because he wouldnt pick me up anymore. i asked him to cancel and he hung up. so i texted him explaining that if i cancel i would be charged $5. he stopped answering and i guess he parked his car on the street and wait there for 5 minutes until i had to cancel. i got another uber, im late for work, and i just think this driver was really unprofessional.
MSG|1080| trip was charged $8 and change for cancellation. driver informed that he was unable to cancel and requested that we did so he can work with the police on the scene. please disclose how uber will cover medical costs if necessary
MSG|1081| this driver stated that he picked me up, when clearly im still at home ordering another ride!!!!
MSG|1082| driver called me and asked me where i was going. it was my first time going to that place and i had an appointment. he then hung up and started going farther.
MSG|1083| driver never picked me up and continued on route to destination without picking me up
MSG|1084| when we get in the car, the driver said i dont do the trip that has a stop. and make us leave the car and make us to cancel the trip.  i still need to pay for the trip and call another uber.
MSG|1085| your app is pretty much worthless. i'll use lyft from now on. the app always assumes that where my phone is is the pick up spot. i put the pick up address in, but it "defaulted" to where my phone is leaving my gf standing outside at 1am waiting for a driver. the driver showed up where my phone is not where she was
MSG|1086| hi,\ni hate canceling an uber.  like i just did.  \n\ni just wanted you to know that originally the app predicted he would be by to pick up in 5 minutes.  then he drove in opposite direction and it went up to 16 minutes!   i called him and he said he was dropping someone else off.  i couldnt wait - had to get to airport.  \n\njust wanted you to know.   i dont like canceling. \n\nthanks. \n\njulia van. juliaavan@gmail.com\n857-205-4337
MSG|1087| this is ridiculous how the driver accepted my ride without me being in the car. and he doesnt answer the phone, and im being charged 22.50 for a ride i did not take. i want all my money back in my account. and im never using uber ever again
MSG|1088| i never got into the uber and the driver started the fare
MSG|1089| i canceled the trip within five minutes
MSG|1090| my driver never picked me up but marked it that he did and then drove towards my destination, again without ever picking us up.
MSG|1091| my driver asked where i was going then refused my trip. this is not allowed in the uber platform and i would like to give this driver 1 star and have uber refund me fee that he caused me. i will be following up by email if my fee is not refunded.
MSG|1092| was taking longer then expected
MSG|1093| he refused to follow waze. he told me he knew better and said al roads were closed. he tried pulling away when my things were still in the back seat bc i was getting my suitcase out of the trunk. he did not help put it in and also refused o end my ride. i took video. what is going on uber. your deivers have become bullies.
MSG|1094| i waited for my driver at the location. they never showed up then the driver said i was picked up. the driver proceeded with the ride and drove to the next drop off location without me.\n\ni was never picked up, nor did i ever see the car. please reverse the charge of the trip.
MSG|1095| 5823
MSG|1096|03pm one minute later the driver called me and informed me he will not be picking me up as he is not going in my direction and informed me i need to cancel. i informed him i will not cancel as i am the passenger waiting for pick up and since he can not fulfill the job he can cancel so another driver can pick me up. he said no and hung up on me. i waited 10 minutes and he did not cancel but stood in the same location. i called him to see if he was going to complete or cancel the ride and he did not answer. i also texted him to ask him to cancel the ride since he had no intentions on picking me up but he once again did not respond or message me in return. i waited a few more moments and canceled the ride for a new driver to pick me up. this driver was very unprofessional and should not be calling customers to informed them he will not be completing a ride.
MSG|1097| the driver refused to provide seatbelts.
MSG|1098| the driver came than i ride the car.  and then the tire got flat and. the driver told the car cant move you should cancel. and i got charged.
MSG|1099| i was charged for a ride i didnt order
MSG|1100| the uber driver accepted the trip as if i was riding but he never passed by to pick me up. the driver had accepted the trip and drove away as is i was inside and continued picking up other passengers. i was never in the ride and i had to cancel because the driver didnt realize and i still got charged the fee as if i rode.
MSG|1101| i requested this trip but had too many people to fit in the vehicle after a few of my friends joined in on the plans so therefore i cancelled it and was still charged the full trip amount even though no one rode with him. i would like to be refunded please.
MSG|1102| my driver never picked me up. she kept going and going to whatever she was going and would not answer my calls.
MSG|1103| driver was suppose to go to address listed as he was transporting a vulnerable adult.  driver ended up going elsewhere.
MSG|1104| i used my uber credit but the driver had to be canceled but i didnt get it back to my account
MSG|1105| i texted driver to give him exact location, he went to wrong location, i then called him, told him where i was and he drove away from my location. please refund cancellation fee.
MSG|1106| it took 13 out my account instead of 8
MSG|1107| my driver never picked me up. this trip never occurred
MSG|1108| i cancelled because it was very far away and was asking me to walk very far my original location... not fair to charge a $5 cancellation fee especially since i cancelled right away!
MSG|1109| the driver started the trip without picking me up. when i cancelled the trip it said the trip was already in progress. wrongly charged for a trip that i did not even start
MSG|1110| would like my money back stood and waited 4 my ride that naver showed up and i was changed a fee
MSG|1111| i need my refund . driver never made it to me or barely even moved closer to me
MSG|1112| i should not be charged a cancellation fee my driver never shower up and i called him several times
MSG|1113| my app glitches and cancelled the ride, but when i opened the app again, i had the same uber driver from before it glitched
MSG|1114| driver was not at the location. looked like maybe he picked someone else up. the uber app showed driver driving toward my destination but not with me.
MSG|1115| she never came to get me and i kept telling her to cancel but she wouldnt cancel it
MSG|1116| the uber app said he was 3 minutes away all of a sudden i see my ride driving towards the highway and didn't pick me up. now i'm late for work cause i had to cancel and get another driver. i kept calling him to see where is he going but he wouldn't answer. i better not get charged. this is ridiculous, this is getting worse and worse every day.
MSG|1117| took longer than 9 minutes and he wasnt moving towards the end for awhile i cant be late refund that $3 to my card please, that passenger had to go this direction anyways, im in a uber x now
MSG|1118| the original driver arrived but pulled off when i attempted to get in the car!!! it made me late to my appointment!
MSG|1119| no
MSG|1120| i actually took this trip and had a nice ride. there was a glitch in the app and the driver called me about 10 minutes later as he could not access his app anymore. the only option we had was to cancel the trip, even though the trip wasnt canceled. i want to be sure i pay for it properly and the driver gets credit.
MSG|1121| he didnt pick me up but put in that i got in the car and drove away i never was on the car and he accepted that i was pick up i would like my money back
MSG|1122| i canceled within seconds. please refund me my money
MSG|1123| i want a full refund i waited more than 10 min for my uber driver i let him know i was on the corner with a pink umbrella. this man drives past me, i call him hes laughing or giggling saying he didnt see me after i described myself to him . i call him back and start to describe where im at im getting soaked in the rain cold for more than 20 min and he just never came back. this is crazy you guys cant make anyone uber drivers. i was stuck in the cold abandoned.
MSG|1124| the driver began the trip immediately upon accepting it and he did not pick me up. so i was paying for a ride in a car that i wasnt in.
MSG|1125| the pick up spot is way too far
MSG|1126| please match me with a female driver
MSG|1127| the driver started the trip without and i was not in the car
MSG|1128| tilasimme yhden kuljetuksen ja kuitissa nkyy yhteissummana 9,3$. tililtni on kuitenkin mennyt rahaa 19,20$
MSG|1129| i was charged the entire price for this ride even though it was canceled
MSG|1130| i would like to be refunded for this trip as my driver could not find me, the app would not let me cancel and i do not think its my fault.
MSG|1131| driver never moved
MSG|1132| the driver never came to get me he left me on the corner and then he stated that i have to cancel hes not canceling he put in the app that he picked me up when i never was in the car that was dangerous to me because he went to my address and i wasnt in the car and i did not know how to cancel
MSG|1133| my card still got charged and i never took the uber i need my 15 dollars back on my card
MSG|1134| i was getting an uber for my sisters boyfriend. the driver called and i told him to go to the parking lot. he picked up the wrong person. probably some random person.  i kept trying to call the driver to tell him that wasnt the right person but he wasnt answering. he wasnt answering so i cancelled. i want a refund
MSG|1135| it said 3 minutes for 5 minutes, then changed to 2 for another 3 mins... i dont believe its fare as a customer who constantly uses your services that i am limited on refunds when something happens that isnt right.
MSG|1136| ali picked us (2 of us) up at our hotel, we verified ourselves to each other and got in his car.  he then started to explain to us that wed be better if walking due to traffic and refused to take us.  i asked him to cancel and he said that he did.  we got out and proceeded to search for another driver and he remained parked arguing with us from the driver seat, window rolled down.  he was arguing that wed have no better luck with another driver.  that was not the case.  we quickly located another driver and were taken to the jiffy lube live venue.  ali should not have accepted the ride if he did not eat to take us!  he also should not have sat there arguing with me on the merits of trying to get another driver!
MSG|1137| why am i charged the full price of the ride
MSG|1138| i was matched with vw jetta, who wasnt moving on the map. when i called him, he didnt pick up. then i finally got to him, he said he cancelled my ride. which clearly couldnt have been the case as i was calling him through the app. and he said the app has been acting strange today - these 10 minutes cost me missing a shownin vegas, i am really upset about such service
MSG|1139| my driver was not responding to texts or calls and did not come to my pickup address and just started my trip without me
MSG|1140| my driver never picked me up, started my ride and started driving away. its really unprofessional and inconvenient to have someone start a ride when im not in the car.
MSG|1141| when i call the uberit didnt shou where i should walk to . i cant saw where the driver and the destination .so i have to canceled this trip.
MSG|1142| i was charged earlier a fee of 3.57 but that driver never should up and my credit card is still reflecting the charge and than an additional 1.43 i dont know why this all happened for todays date!
MSG|1143| i had the incorrect address in my pickup zone location.
MSG|1144| driver didnt move closer to my location for nearly 15 minutes. in addition, i made two attempts to call the driver and one attempt to text them and received no response. i am now delayed 20 minutes.
MSG|1145| the driver picked up the wrong person.
MSG|1146| i have to be at work at a certain time because i am a supervisor. the drivers expected arrival time kept changing. it went from 8 minutes to 12 minutes to 4 minutes to 10 minutes. i did not want to cancel but i had no choice.
MSG|1147| after he said he had nobodies where he was going, i asked to be dropped off. he jerked the car quickly without signal. he then laughed at me and glares. he then squealed out of the school zone after i got out. he should not drive for uber. call
MSG|1148| the driver did not pick me up and started the ride. someone else took my ride.
MSG|1149| my driver refused to pick me up at the point! i shouldnt be charged for this!
MSG|1150| he never came to pick me up and just confirmed the pick up and left
MSG|1151| someone else took my ride
MSG|1152| he did not show or answer my call
MSG|1153| couldnt not find driver. tried calling them 3 times and they would not answer.
MSG|1154| the driver was very far away so i called lyft who had a driver 3 minutes away. i should never have to wait 15 minutes for an uber pick up. absurd
MSG|1155| we waited for pick up, then the driver confirmed pick up and the app said we were headed towards the destination but we remained on the same corner with no ride. so basically, he lied and said he picked us up. we waited ten minutes, requested a second uber, couldnt get it, then just decided to get a taxi.
MSG|1156| my driver picked up someone else and drove off. i called and messaged him bur he did not respond which is why i cancelled the trip
MSG|1157| i got charge for a cancellation fee i dont take the ride
MSG|1158| i dont cancel the ride something happened
MSG|1159| can i get a credit for my cancellation. i cancelled within a minute of my pool reservation. however i had to cancel because the driver was 7mins away & i would be late for my appointment. the trip was cancelled when the driver was 6mins away.
MSG|1160| so i went to go take a trip earlier this morning and it said my payment declined and then there was another trip that was taken out but i never took it it was for 6.75
MSG|1161| i cancelled because he was 7 minutes away from my destination. it was to long to wait
MSG|1162| this gentlemen never came to me on the gps, he actually was driving away
MSG|1163| i was charged and i cancelled the trip
MSG|1164| my driver and me did not find each other, i never entered the car and we never met, so there was no trip happening.
