MSG|1834| i want the credit back on my card.
MSG|1835| the driver said refused to take us
MSG|1836| i had to cancel this trip because there seemed to be a glitch in the system. somehow it wouldnt accept my home address in midtown manhattan and placed it in california rather than new york. the driver ditched us after a while. could the fees related to this trip be reimbursed? he basically drove us a block and abandoned us.
MSG|1837| i ordered an uber but it had the wrong destination it was supposed to be for my home however when the driver picked me up it said my final destination was queens center mall.
MSG|1838| my driver was going in the opposite direction and wouldnt answer my calls
MSG|1839| driver never picked me up she text and she had an emergency and you guys charged me $9.26 something like i need to be reimbursed before my account goes in to negative
MSG|1840| he didnt even pick me up. the cancellation fee should be waived as he left without me.
MSG|1841| i cancelled this trip too soon and 4.90 $ was taken from my card.
MSG|1842| my co riders made me question my safety and continued to asked my uber driver to make the other passenger leave the car and my driver still did not have him removed even after multiple threats and an argument in the way home. i had to end up walking home in the dark alone which as a female is very unsafe and as far as that i will never step foot in another uber again if this is they way they allow things to run in their company. something way more detrimental could have happens to me than just being threatened and hit i could not have eve made but home. i cant believe a company has let itself go so down hill
MSG|1843| the driver eta was 1 minute away for at least 5 minutes. i tried to message and call and received no response. very unprofessional.
MSG|1844| i canceled and lost my amex platinum credit when i tried to book another ride 2 minutes later
MSG|1845| i gave specific instructions for the driver to find me. never had an issue. his only response was that hes outside. clearly nowhere near me. i dont have time to play around with your drivers.
MSG|1846| driver didnt move to pick me up
MSG|1847| i didn't get on the limousine, which was an unreasonable charge
MSG|1848| i didn't get in the car
MSG|1849| i was never picked up. the driver never came. i shouldnt be charged for this. i got a separate uber which you can see. thank you
MSG|1850| please pay him, the cancellation was by accident. the driver did drop us off at location.
MSG|1851| the driver was assigned multiple trips and the end time kept being added in rush hour, including we had to double back to pick someone up
MSG|1852| my driver was intially 7 minutes away and i had been waiting for almost thirty minutes. he was driving away from and would refuse my calls multiple times. this is not the first time ive had an issue. for someone who is labeled above a 4 star i am greatly disappointed and wish to be contacted back as soon as possible to discuss this.
MSG|1853| need my money bacc!
MSG|1854| my uber app was not responding and i was not aware that a driver accepted my ride because it was taking too long searching so i tried to cancel and send another request
MSG|1855| cant find the driver
MSG|1856| the uber wanted me to walk over 20 blocks for a pool (clearly a mistake) and therefore i cancelled. however here it says $0.0 for the receipt and my bank was still charged the $17.42 for the original trip.
MSG|1857| no
MSG|1858| i never requested this uber. i requested two ubers before you guys switched to this one. the first one canceled and when i requested another uber yall sent the same one who didnt show up the first time. she texted me trying to get me to cancel so she could still get paid. i told her no and all of sudden yall sent this guy who i didnt request. so therefore im not paying for this cancellation cause i didnt request the third uber
MSG|1859| my drop off location was incorrect. i requested another ride with the correct address immediately and got the driver i initially was paired with.
MSG|1860| 8495
MSG|1861| i was never picked up
MSG|1862| driver never picked me up but marked me as picked up. when i called him, asked me to cancel the ride. please refund my money.
MSG|1863| i got the same driver 3 times and gave up on getting a different driver. remove the cancellation fee.
MSG|1864| driver wasn't moving my way
MSG|1865| you don't offer choice for driver texted enroute  that he had to use bathroom. furious that he accepted me when he was 15min away, then doesn't send text until 5min away that he has to use bathroom. i texted for his to stop at gas station. he texted "i have to poop so i cancel'.  i wasted 15 minutes for him and he should not have accepted my request if he had to use a toilet. also i do not know if he was implying that he wanted to use the bathroom in my house, but that is why my response was "go to gas station'. totally uprofessional!
MSG|1866| driver asked me to cancel die to an emergency upon pickup. i took another ride shortly after cancelling this ride. why have i been charged for the whole ride?
MSG|1867| my driver started the trip without me in the car
MSG|1868| my uber cash balance was 116 dollars , and my last ride was 11 dollars , how my balance became 85 dollars ??
MSG|1869| i cancelled the ride before you found me a driver and i just put 25$ on gift card amd i only have 14$ why?
MSG|1870| the driver kept changing the pickup time to later and later and later and would not pick up amy of my phone calls so i finally had to cancel and call a new uber because the bar was closing so i should not be charged a cancellation fee when he never moved in the direction of my route the entirety of my 20+ minute wait time
MSG|1871| my driver picked up the wrong person i had to wait outside in the rain with my son for the driver to come back around 7 minutes later ....
MSG|1872| the driver answered the phone while driving, turned up the radio loudly and kept raising his voice. i felt extremely disrespected and unsafe. so much so that i got out and took the train.
MSG|1873| i dont think i was charged a cancellation fee but uber took my money for this trip and has yet to put it back on my card
MSG|1874| i was charged for this ride too...
MSG|1875| this wasnt the issue but there is no way to contact uber.  when booking i was offered a round trip fare.  however i then was matched w/ a driver 10 minutes away.  it takes 20 minutes to get to my work already setting me up to be late.  i didnt take the ride, i had to cancel and ride with lyft.  i would like my $23.98 fee refunded.
MSG|1876| my driver was two blocks away from my location even though i turned off the option to walk , i had been waiting nearly 15 minutes prior
MSG|1877| the uber said he picked me up when he never did, and charged me the money when i never did the trip
MSG|1878| i never got in this car and they charged me the dude never even showed up and drove all the way down the freeway pst me just to turn back and never pick me up
MSG|1879| creepy and extremely uncomfortable took a ride with him to a different house waited 5 min called a new one and he accepted it again. i dont know who he is but he is very creepy and was asking too many questions about who we were and where we lived. even talked about coming to our cribs and knocking on our doors.
MSG|1880| please credit me back the $5. i stood outside in the rain for what appears to be over 2 mins and the driver remained at 6 mins away. the two girls standing next to me requested ubers which were 3-4 mins away and they arrived. also, i pay a ton of wait time fees when the drivers do not wait for me. they dont start the drive for a while and i never dispute this.
MSG|1881| i was still charged for the fare last night even though it was canceled.  for both of them i was charged.  i would like it to be refunded
MSG|1882| 3 separate riders including myself joined at the same time. the driver's app interface did not allow him to check the box saying i had joined the trip. he had to scroll down to see the box but as soon as he lifted his finger from the screen it scrolled back up. while his finger was on the screen he was unable to check the box by tapping with another finger. i had to cancel and get another ride causing me delays.
MSG|1883| my receipt said i was gonna get a refund for my money but i still havent received my refund that was $4.72
MSG|1884| uber still charge me for $10.07
MSG|1885| uber driver never meet with me due to location. another uber was requested. i dont feel like i should be charged. please help
MSG|1886| never took a ride for this amount
MSG|1887| the driver canceled in front of me saying he had wrong address which was a lie to me it was racest! and u charged me double.why?
MSG|1888| i would like a refund, your driver was very unaccommodating i scheduled an uber pick up for my 75 year old grandmother, not only did he not come to the correct pick up spot he gave me a hard time when trying to get help in finding him. i definitely dont feel like i should have been charged still $10 at that which is basically the cost of the ride when he didnt even pick her up she had to get into another cab. if im not refunded this will certainly become a bigger issue
MSG|1889| i will keep sharing until my voice is heard i felt threat by this driver because it was in camden and as soon i want to enter d car another  driver came in  from no where he refuse to cancel me and d driver was confused he asked me if its 2 of us i said no.. and the was scared to tell the guy i have to get down from the argument i need my full money.
MSG|1890| hey i felt unsafe because as soon as he pick me in camden someone can in right away trying to so what o was not safe i told him .i wasn't sure about him and he was asking me what to do
MSG|1891| driver never picked up and started trip without me
MSG|1892| driver started the ride 3 mins before his pickup eta. i never got in the car. when i called to ask if he was coming, he said "i ain't got no stacy"
MSG|1893| my driver did not pick me up! he picked up someone with a similar name to me and swiped that he picked me up! then he did not even cal or let me know if his mistake! he ask didnt answer when i tried to contact him the first time. extremely upset.
MSG|1894| i didnt took the ride.
MSG|1895| i know i wasnt charged but i wanted to go into detail. my driver accepted my drive and then messaged me that he had another person to drop off first, there were other drivers in my area. not sure why he accepted my ride when he had another rider with him. at 20 minutes after i requested the original uber he was still 9 minutes away. now i am late for a meeting at work when i requested the original uber half hour before my meeting which should have gotten me there about 15 minutes early. its super frustrating.
MSG|1896| this is rather odd. i didnt even get a chance to ride inside the uber car, but it showed me that i was riding inside and on to my destination. and because of that, i had no choice but to cancel the trip. if i wasnt charged for the cancellation fee or the trip at all, then its fine, but i feel a little flustered that the uber driver assumed he was driving me to my destination when i wasnt even in the car.
MSG|1897| i changed my destination, and my driver didnt end my ride when i got out the car. therefore, i had no choice but to cancel it. my pickup location was 8257 s ellis ave. my drop off location was 63rd cottage grove green line station.
MSG|1898| the driver was too far away. 12 minutes for a pool ride is too far. the $3 needs to be reversed or else im just going to have to end up using lyft only.
MSG|1899| charged for a ride i never took. do not charge my account for services not provided
MSG|1900| my driver never came to my location , he pickup phone to hang up . and uber still charged me
MSG|1901|34 pm and the cab was set to pick me up in 5 mins. i was outside waiting the whole time and saw the cab driver pass my pickup location. for moment, it looked as if he was coming back around the block but never did. he proceeded to drive further away from me while i waited about 20 minutes before canceling.
MSG|1902| i have pictures and screen shot. this person did not come get me. i cant believe i have to pay a cancellation fee. he didnt pick up his phone or answer me
MSG|1903| the uber chose a different drop off address than the one i chose.
MSG|1904| my driver did not move towards my pickup, did not answer any of my four phone calls, and did not respond to my numerous messages. i am disgusted. this made me have to drive to work to avoid being late and pay $20 to park in the building parking deck. i have screenshots to provide support. this was so frustrating, that it made me consider never using uber again. $20 paid after waiting for this person who refused to answer mecompletely unacceptable.
MSG|1905| the driver did not pick me up but start the ride.
MSG|1906| the driver never showed up and the app was not working properly. it was very stressful. we ended up having to call a taxi.
MSG|1907| he refused to take me home and im a young girl. it was extremely unprofessional and he was extremely rude
MSG|1908| this driver took a longer route
MSG|1909| driver never picked up anyone. started the trip & didn't answer when i called.
MSG|1910| i got charged for a cancellation fee .. and my driver phone mustve died because he had me waiting outside for 35 mins .. in a deserted place and he never picked me up .. he didnt answer none of the calls nor did he respond to my text message all he did was read my first message and after that nothing .. i dont appreciate what happened and thats not how you run a business .. so i shouldnt be charged for canceling fee at all ..
MSG|1911| this was a scheduled ride that did not arrive within the scheduled time window. 3 different drivers picked up the ride at different points, with none of them actually heading to pick me up. this caused me to be extremely late to the airport. i would like uber credits for the problems caused.
MSG|1912| hi. i would like a refund for this trip i never took. the driver marked me as "picked up" and i could not find my designated pick up spot after they did that so i cancelled the trip and ordered a new one. i would like my $10.49 back please. i already spend enough money on uber as it is so i would greatly appreciate the refund.
MSG|1913| there should not be a cancellation fee with this ride; the driver collected the wrong person, so i cancelled after he drove away. he then return that passenger and i rebooked him. please reimburse me for the cancellation fee. thank you.
MSG|1914| being a gold member states that my cancelation fees will be refunded. how long till my uber cash is replenished?
MSG|1915| the taxi never arrived
MSG|1916| driver refused to drive me to my address said it was too far and forced me out of the car.
MSG|1917| when will i get my money back for the trip i didnt even go to and money back for the cancellation fee?
MSG|1918| so uber decided to randomly throw in a code before the driver can drop you off and uber never sent a code to the app or my phone number and my driver ended up not being able to take me to my destination. my time and hard earned money keep getting wasted and i demand a refund
MSG|1919| driver kept driving away from us and when i called he was 10mins away versus supposed to be 3mins away.  he said i should cancel and then when i rebooked i was charged $3 more for the new trip.  on top of this i am going to be late.  this is ridiculous.
MSG|1920| the driver did not even move the car. i was waiting for 40 minutes and kept messaging him asking nicely to cancel the trip.
MSG|1921| my driver started the trip without me and sent my call to voicemail three times. i cancelled the trip and tried to make another one twice and it continued to give me the same driver. i do not want to be charged for the ride i did not take and the two $3 cancellations.
MSG|1922| he never picked me up despite me being at location and didnt cancel drove as if i was present in vehicle very dissatisfied and disappointed in his professionalism
MSG|1923| why is a honda accord listed as an upscale ride in las vegas? there was no way i was going to pay over $40 for a ride in a honda accord. seriously, uber, please look into what you classify as an upscale vehicle.
MSG|1924| this fucking person took the wrong guy  give me my fucking money back
MSG|1925| she would not move toward my location or answer my calls.  she would also not cancel so i would be charged the fee.  this is a bad driver
MSG|1926| please refund. my driver was not moving towards my pick up.
MSG|1927| the wait time on this trip was too long(6mins) and it was raining hence why i had to cancel. driver only drove 12seconds
MSG|1928| how is it taking 10+ minutes each time i request a ride. it seems like everyone else gets a ride in 2-3 minutes
MSG|1929| i think this is an unjust charge being that it said he would be there in 3 min and then we waited for more than 10 min and he was still a ways away and said he went to a different location that was not out pick up point.
MSG|1930| driver went to the wrong pick up area
MSG|1931| driver called to ask where i was going and then sat at a wawa for over 5min until i canceled.
MSG|1932| i would like to switch my payment method... this is a company card and this is a personal trip.. please switch to card ending in *2262
MSG|1933| i was not able to get to this uber and my uber was charged to my card while on the app it says it wasnt.
MSG|1934| 
MSG|1935| n/a
MSG|1936| the driver didnt show up and the trip was marked as started without the driver picking me up. i had to call a separate uber
MSG|1937| my driver was not at my pickup location. i called several times and explained he was not at my location
MSG|1938| hi my cancellation fee says i received my money back but i still havent seen the reversal for the $10.30 which really makes me upset i was charged because my driver was very unprofessional, i was leaving a event and i did a select uber driver and then i called my driver to confirm and he kept asking me but where are you going?! i didnt understand what the point of that was it shouldnt matter. i had a uber attendant that was walking around help me and the driver would keep denying his calls especially when he told him he was a partner with uber. all i wanted was a ride home after a long night and that driver ruined it. \nif you could please send me back my $10.30 i would appreciate, thank you!
MSG|1939| i have to be honest here!! the first driver canceled and then with out my permission uber sent another driver. i waited 20 minutes or more for the first one... why would i continue to wait? and now youve charged me a cancellation fee!! uber should ask the customer if they want another driver sent. if this happens again ill stop using your service!
MSG|1940| my driver never show up at the location i was at.  i called him multiple times for half an hour and he has a hard time communicating and when i asked if he is going to come and get me multiple times.  he hung up on me.  as i waited half an hour and running late to the airport, i cancelled and book another car.  i sent him multiple messages as well to tell him i am at the 700 louisiana sv entrance.  that still did not help.  i should not be charged anything at all as i was early waiting for him for half an hour.
MSG|1941| he stayed at his location for 6 minutes before i called. when i spoke to him he said he was coming immediately but did not move in the next five minutes. please contact me if you need screenshots of the timing.
MSG|1942| i was charged 8 dollers and the driver lied and said he picked me up and i was never picked up. i need someone to reach out to me for a refund!!
MSG|1943| my driving refused picking me up and also refused to cancel. i waited for long and the waiting minutes kept increasing and i called him several times to pick me up or cancel, he refused i had no choice but to cancel.
MSG|1944| please refund my fare. this driver was 11 minutes away thats entirely too long. i have 5 mins to cancel a ride before being charge correct ? refund my money
MSG|1945| drivers are always taken more money from my gift cards then suppose to
MSG|1946| the driver has all windows open and the ac blasting when i arrived. after a few blocks i realized why- there was a horribly strong smell of chemicals. i kept my face out by the window for a few blocks but after a bit couldnt take it anymore, so i asked her if something had spilled, she said oh its just month balls. i said i had to get out of the car- i am a breastfeeding mother and cant be inhaling poison for an hour long ride. asked her to pull over so i could grab another ride. she was definitely nice about it, but still, not ok. and i now have a pounding headache from it.
MSG|1947| the is no sode walk major highway. the only way to walk there is through grass not even a real corner. theres a canal there.
MSG|1948| its not about me receiving a cancellation fee i sat and waited 32 for no car to show up
MSG|1949| i have been waiting for a uber for over 20 min when initially it was 9 . the driver continues to drive away from my pick up location ignore my text and calls this is extremely unprofessional and i have screenshots to prove
MSG|1950| i am very upset about this ride being that he never showed up and failed to answer my phone calls. i waited 25 minutes on a nine minute uber. i am now missing my cousins wedding ceremony. i need contacted about this asap as i am extremely livid.
MSG|1951| i was charge $10.35 when the driver didnt pick me up
MSG|1952| the driver asked me to cancel my trip before arriving at the destination since she want me to rebook a my new destination, but she took me further away from the destination and rejected me to take me to my original destination i booked. i have to walk in the rain to find another uber.  thats not the right way to do things
MSG|1953| i had to cancel .. because the driver never arrived.  i waited for 20 minutes and it did not arrive
MSG|1954| driver did not come to correct location.
MSG|1955| ?
MSG|1956| please switch this to the personal account rather than the business. thank you
MSG|1957| i have been charged $24.99 for this trip + $3.67, that i canceled because he didnt move from the same place for more than 10 min
MSG|1958| i accidentally purchased 100$ in uber cash on monday, may 27, 2019 that i need and as a result over drafted my account. i would like to reverse this charge please
MSG|1959| to take my kid 5 years old kids without a car seat been riding with him for years on uber
MSG|1960| this driver was nowhere near me when the app suddenly showed that the trip was already in progress. so the app was saying the trip was already en route when he never actually picked me up. i tried calling him and he didnt answer. i question the validity of this uber driver. please look into his crudentials, because something very questionable happened with this ride
MSG|1961| the app was stuck or frozen. i've been at the airport for 30 minutes and it was still showing that i was in the honda.
MSG|1962| i need you guys to put my 5.34 cents back to my bank account i canceled those rides far before the driver was even at the pickup location
MSG|1963| the driver immediately called me and asked me where i was going. i repeated myself several times and he kept saying different cities. it was as though he no longer wanted the fare. i asked him to cancel and he said ok but he appeared not to. i do not understand why he did not k ow my destination
MSG|1964| when i got the uber - it suddenly went from 1 minute away to 12 minutes away. the driver knowingly went a different direction given knowing the fair was going to hike. my ride went from 27 bucks to 52 bucks and it surged so much i couldnt do another uber. this is very shady and unacceptable
MSG|1965| the driver went to a gas station! if you dont return my cancellation fee i am canceling uber forever
MSG|1966| driver sent me a message saying the app was not working properly and that she was cancelling the trip... so i called another uber.
MSG|1967| driver was more than 14 minutes away from me and i urgently needed to go home. the driver wasnt close at all thats why i canceled
MSG|1968| apparently the guy started the trip and i'm not in the car how is this possible
MSG|1969| nobody ever showed up!  why use this to schedule a ride in advance.   now my son's family may miss their flight to get to my other sons wedding!
MSG|1970| driver did not pick me up at my location, instead drove straight to my destination when i wasnt even in the car
MSG|1971| no
MSG|1972| i was matched with this driver for a scheduled trip from ramsey, nj to stamford, ct. she texted me (not through the app) rudely asking me where i was going, and upon responding, told me she refused to drive outside of nj despite having seen her just complete a trip in ny state on the app. she did not cancel on her end so i was forced to wait. i finally canceled and have missed my train from stamford amtrak station after driving myself the 45 mins. i have a screenshot of the messages she sent me, and i am beyond annoyed. make this right, please.
MSG|1973| 
MSG|1974| the driver didnt come to my pickup location. the route isnt complicated. so there was no way for him to make a mistake. because i waited for him 20 minutes, i missed my appointment. if he came directly even after i waited, i could have made it.
MSG|1975| this driver took over an hour. he could not find the standard rideshare spot. he was an absolute asshole on the phone. from this point forward i am strictly lyft. this guy has absolutely ruined uber for me.
MSG|1976| i called for an uber like for times they said they were busy an unavailable a couple times. they chargedmy account a few times. i should only have 1 charge for 13.17 from target to 6204 palmer avenue mays landing
MSG|1977| thought i could cancel and rebook without a fee?
MSG|1978| my pickup location was in the middle of a freeway? im going to get hit by a car there, this isnt fair
MSG|1979| someone took my uber and proceeded to charge me.
MSG|1980| driver refused to drop me off after i told them they can take embarcadero to cross market due to bay to breakers. they didnt even try to find an alternate route. i want my uber cash refunded as that is what i used to pay for the fare.
MSG|1981| uber app was asking me to walk to the highway behind my building to get picked up and there is no sidewalk
MSG|1982| i was charged fully for this ride and not just the $5.00 cancellation fee-pls reimburse me for the ride and only charge the cancellation fee
MSG|1983| the guy refused to come to where i was located for over 10 mins. its unacceptable.
MSG|1984| driver took off without notifying me he was here and pulled away. our bags were on the driveway and he never notified us that he was there. we came out as soon as we saw him and i saw him pull off. he told me he had another pick up. i do not feel i should pay for this.
MSG|1985| tinted black windows
MSG|1986| i never took neither did i cancelled it, so why did i got charged?
MSG|1987| this driver is out of control! i was so scared. i thought for sure i was being kidnapped. he didn't even follow the app or use it!
MSG|1988| give me my money back,  the guy didn't even have to drive here.
MSG|1989| the driver refused to come to 1 franklin street, instead coming to "payless" which wasn't the location. he also refused to drive down the road to 1 feanklin, even after instructions. he drove away.
MSG|1990| he passed my location when i was outside and then he wasnt moving. i called him but he did not answwr
MSG|1991| driver asked me where i was going & refused my ride & wouldnt cancel ride
MSG|1992| the car never picked me up and started the trip regardless.
MSG|1993| ravjeet basi
MSG|1994| my driver never showed up then called and argued with me very unprofessional
MSG|1995| i was there with my walket and driver slowed down then continued on
MSG|1996| he asked for my age and said i cant ride without an adult. i am 19 years old.
MSG|1997| i had 1 stop then i was supposed to get taken back home but the driver left me and i was still changed
MSG|1998|40, the driver was lost and five minutes away and shortly thereafter he was given an additional pickup further delaying me so i cancelled. i then requested another car and the same driver picked up the call again.  i cancelled again and was charged the fee. i hope you will agree to refund it. on a separate note, on wednesday night, 5/8, i left a lunch bag and its contents including a thermos and a book reader in the car. i have tried to reach dialo, the driver, but i haven't even gotten the courtesy of a return call. can you help?  it's been lots of bad service lately. tonight the driver could not find the pickup point for me and another passenger,  marlene. after multiple attempts to find the taxi stand unsuccessfully,  we finally endeavored to find him.   we waited again for a third passenger who never found the driver's location. rant over. please assist. sincerest thanks,  howard.
