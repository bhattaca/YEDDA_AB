MSG|2166| i tried updating my address and it wouldnt let me so i had to cancel
MSG|2167| why uber charge me 8 $ i left the car in 1 min and cancel it
MSG|2168| did not need to go to ride
MSG|2169| i waited ten minutes for my driver to arrive.  when he found out it would be a 40 minute journey, he refused to take the ride.  very unprofessional.
MSG|2170| i had a trip on may 19 and i was waiting for my uber driver at the designated location and he didnt show up. i tried contacting him through the uber app, but he never answered me and there was no way for me to contact him via phone call or text (his phone # was not available on the app?). however, he accepted the trip as if i was already in the car (but i wasnt), which made it impossible to contact him again. as a regular uber user, this was extremely frustrating as i had just gotten off a long flight and had to wait a long time for an uber driver that never showed up. id like to be refunded for this cancellation fee. thank you.
MSG|2171| driver crashed his car. so never came to us.
MSG|2172| my driver did not speak any english and could not find out the pick up location, he was situated on another floor, i had an airport attendant call him and speak to him in spanish and reiterate the uber share rides location at the airport for which we then proceeded to continuously wait and he still could not find it or communicate effectively . i want a cancellation refund.
MSG|2173| i received my cancellation fee credit but did want to complain about this driver. the whole reason for needing an uber (with suitcases) was because it was pouring rain earlier. she pulled up to my address but across the street and refused to meet me on my side. if it wasnt bad weather i would of had no problem crossing over, and when i called her she had an attitude. i dont think i was unreasonable for asking her to come to my side especially because if her car would of ended up soaking wet inside she would of been upset.
MSG|2174| i see zero on my receipt but also see a fee of $9.17 charged on my card. please help me understand this as i would like a full refund as the driver never even started coming my way.  so i cancelled. thank you.
MSG|2175| the driver skipped my place and when i tried calling, they didnt answer.
MSG|2176| drivers kept canceling and i needed to get to the metro so i can catch my flight to atl. that driver was 13 mins out
MSG|2177| first, he asked how many people and where the destination was, which was already in the app. it was just me requesting the service. then he said he was going to be 20 minutes late because the police had stopped him and he was getting a speeding ticket. but he didnt cancel the service, i had to.
MSG|2178| my driver never picked me up and took the ride on her own i need my money back right now
MSG|2179| he was taking forever from a pickup point fifteen minutes away. it was quicker to walk to a bus stop and take public transit. in boston that is saying a lot and its not good
MSG|2180| my uber driver did not get me to my destination. he drove right past my turn and then wouldnt stop and continued south. i requested to get out and then he didnt end the ride. i would like a refund.
MSG|2181| drivers phone wasnt connecting to service and was demanding i open my app and make sure i called the uber. started driving opposite direction of destination and was loudly voicing complaints and how he lives near my destination and would love to drive a customer towards home. wasnt going the right way. didnt know where he was. made me so uncomfortable i had him take me back home so i could call a lyft.
MSG|2182| hello - i was charged on my chase account for a trip i took on wednesday even though it says i wasnt charged on the app. id like to dispute this charge as the driver was having issue with his app and was unable to cancel the ride so i had to cancel for him.
MSG|2183| you took from me &10.24 today, but i am not riding uber today.
MSG|2184| jenny, my first driver, did not arrive nor answered my txt and calls, so i cancelled and requested another driver who showed. thank you, daniel tommie
MSG|2185| driver was very rude. stoped at a stop sign and then he started to honk a few times without stopping and i had my both arms with grocery bags and he didn't want to stop at the corner to pick me up. he wanted me to walk to him. i was not paying for a shared ride.  i thought he was very unprofessional he looked angry so cancelled my ride because of that.
MSG|2186| i had a drive whose door i was standing at and she drive away. she was extremely rude and canceled my ride. we did nothing, not even drunk. she was so rude to her customers. i will never be using ever again with this type of service. just wanted you to be aware of this behavior
MSG|2187| this driver did not pick me up. his car was full with other riders and he did not have space for me. he left me and refused to cancel the ride after i asked him multiple times. i would like a full refund for the ride. this is unacceptable.
MSG|2188| every single driver canceled on me!!!!! i was waiting outside for nearly 1 hour. my battery lost 35% if its power just with the uber app open for so long. each time i booked a pool the interface suggests my driver assignment is imminent. but instead im told that details will be loaded in a moment. what a lie. i wasted an hour of my life because of these fake messages in the uber app. i have to figure out another way home now because i missed all the public transit options. this was so frustrating. i booked a lyft instead and it came right away. horrible service from uber.
MSG|2189| i had to book 2x to get to my destination. as you can see the driver said i had to cancel to take to correct destination. hence the 2nd uber fare.
MSG|2190| i told her the name of my uber and she didn't want to pick me up
MSG|2191| my driver was taking longer that expected and wasn't moving towards my pick up location. eta extended 6 minutes and he was the same 4 minutes away
MSG|2192| the uber never left our location he asked to update the destination which i tried to do, but the app would not update. he could not cancel the trip so i had to and we never took the ride. i would like to submit a dispute and request a refund for this trip.
MSG|2193| the driver were not moving for 30mins.
MSG|2194| i should not have to pay a fee for cancelling this trip.  i am at the airport.  i called twice and text messaged twice to confirm the pickup spot.  i speak english, and she spoke to me in spanish and i could not understand anything she was saying.  she was rude.  i cancelled the ride because i need to get home and could not communicate with the driver after attempting to meet for over 5 minutes.
MSG|2195| when i requested it showed me 5 mins and i waited for 10 mins but still i dont see any move from driver in uber app, as i have meeting and i need to go early  i cancelled his ride and requested new one. again he picked my ride and came late .. i am completely frustrated with his ride.
MSG|2196| this driver never bothered to pick me up, contact me or respond to my phone call while never attempting to drive to my location!  ive waited 20 mins for him and am already late for work!  i want compensation for my time and a free ride!
MSG|2197| look at the from to. it's a mistake from st. joseph's hospital to st. joseph's hospital!?
MSG|2198| i didnt canceled my trip . the driver canceled so please i dont want to be charged even though i request another trip.
MSG|2199| my phone was on in my pocket and ordered this uber without me knowing or needing it
MSG|2200| my driver ignored my 4 calls was no where to be found and completely ignored me i was wrongly charged and i wont accept this amount i want an immediate refund that was very unprofessional i stood in the pick up spot for about 30 minutes waiting in 46 degree whether.
MSG|2201| car had marijuana smell, driver was falling asleep while driving on highway. i had to continuously wake her up!! very dangerous especially at 5am with 18 wheelers next to us!!
MSG|2202| i didnt go to the this location. !!!    this is a scam !!!
MSG|2203| good evening!\nafter request uber x the driver never went to my location he started driving away towards laguardia parking waiting lot i texted and called him but no answer, it's anacceptable this the second time this week that this happened to me. at least if he doesn't want trip to cancel so i can request another one not letting me hanging in front of my house for 30 min totally unprofessional!\ni would like to have the cancellation fee reimbursed back to my card.\nthanks
MSG|2204| i didnt see a notification that my driver was on the way and had to look for myself. when i opened it she was so far away and i was not confident i would get picked up on time based off the time i was given. please wave this fee if youd like me to continue to use your services. thank you.
MSG|2205| my driver never moved. for 10 minutes it still said 7 minutes away. shouldnt be charged a cancel fee for a non moving driver.
MSG|2206| i have a promotion for 10 off i don't know why it's not being applied please help me it's 10 off for 10 rides
MSG|2207|25 a.m. i believe. i will send screenshots to prove how long i waited and he went further and further away from me
MSG|2208| my driver was pulled over and was in a rental car. also didn't end my trip after
MSG|2209| diver i could not find. contacted the driver several times, no response via phone or message.
MSG|2210| my driver never picked me up! i want a call from uber immediately!
MSG|2211| the location for my pick up changed it reversed from where i was going to where i was and i texted the driver and tried to called to no response
MSG|2212| hi! i was not charged a cancellation fee, but my uber cash was deducted as if i took this ride (went from about $22 to $13).
MSG|2213| the car was too far so i cancelled and it still charged my 5 dollar uber cash and didnt refund me
MSG|2214| there was a mistake when i was adding stops to my ride, so my driver told me to just cancel and reorder an uber to get her again. she said to contact you guys because she saw that it still charged me. if you look at my ride history you can see that the same driver still took me to my destination, and you can even contact her and shell tell you the same thing.
MSG|2215| i was told by uber staff at edc over the loudphones to continue cancelling my trip until a driver that was closer was located. i believe these cancellation fees should be waived due to the backlog of passengers/wait times/staff advice. thank you.
MSG|2216| i thought because i am platinum as long as i request within 15 minutes i do not have a cancellation fee
MSG|2217| the driver did not end the trip after dropping me off. so 30 mins later, i canceled the trip. why is the cancellation fee higher than my original ride estimate?
MSG|2218| he drop me off in middle of my trip he said he have to go pickup his family member so he want me to cancel the trip i want my fees back
MSG|2219| i was charged $8 when my ride was supposed to be 6.75 and he dropped me 10 blocks away from my home i have a video of him to proof he was so rude
MSG|2220| it is absurd and unprofessional that uber expects me to waste 10+ minutes on a ride that can cancel at the last second without offering me any sort of discount or credit for my time. i expect compensation for my wasted time or a discount on future trips or will not be utilizing this app
MSG|2221| i had to cancel my trip cause the driver told me it was a 1 min ride from my pick up spot to my drop off location, i didnt know cause im not familiar with the area. i didnt take the ride, and the driver wont cancel it, he said it will look bad on his record.
MSG|2222| never took this ride
MSG|2223| i had a different issue on why i cancelled. i don't want to walk but for some reason i don't get the pool option anymore, only pool express.
MSG|2224| i never got into the ride and the driver confirmed that i entered, so i cancelled it.
MSG|2225| yes
MSG|2226| estimates were too unreliable. uber estimated i would get to work by 10 without adjusting for a 9 minute wait time that was not going down. cant be late to work again after spending 45 min in an uber yesterday with bad routes and out of the way pickups.
MSG|2227| no
MSG|2228| please call me asap 409-656-7136
MSG|2229| i would like my money refunded because the driver did not pick me up
MSG|2230| it's not about the fees. i have a bus to catch and this guy drives past me without stopping, i make repeated calls on the phone and no response. there should have been at least the courtesy to let me know if he wasn't ready to pick me up, or at the very least pickup the call. i could've ordered for another ride.  this is totally unacceptable from any uber driver. i am disappointed with this experience.
MSG|2231| i waited for my driver for over 15 minutes and he never showed.  the app said he was 4 minutes away.  i should not be charged a fee for a driver that never showed and wouldnt respond to my texts or phone calls when i contacted him
MSG|2232| my driver never picked me up and when i called he said his car was full ? why was i charged
MSG|2233| he drove around in circles and then drove away. i tried calling
MSG|2234| i would like to make sure i wasnt charged for my trip because the driver never drove to the pick up and didnt pick up the phone
MSG|2235| please remove the hold from my bank
MSG|2236| i got dropped off at a closer destination and the driver never ended my trip. i pressed canceled and got charged a higher price then the original trip
MSG|2237| my trip was not cancelled. my driver took me to my destination and i paid him $20 cash because he said app showed cancelled. i didnt cancel it and should not be charged a cancel fee. paid for my trip and other than this issue was ok
MSG|2238| i had to cancel my ride because the driver picked up the wrong person and i repeatedly called him and he didnt pick up
MSG|2239| my tried to cancel the trip it hit it 10 times never let me cancel the trip until the driver showed up
MSG|2240| i don't know why i'm charged an extra $20 or so when i updated the address to a shorter distance??
MSG|2241| the driver was 2 mins away and i waited over 10 mins and he kept moving in opposite direction and then was 7 mins away at the moment i canceled. he was clearly lost
MSG|2242| no it was just my driver johel
MSG|2243| the driver was extremely rude and hostile, she does not have an appropriate demeanor to be a driver
MSG|2244| the driver picked someone else up and said he picked me up and then drove away
MSG|2245| driver called, was rude and curt, waiting for me across the intersection from which i had moved the pin to show my pickup location. once in car, the driver mumbles something about his door then told me to get out. never had such a rude encounter with uber. no wonder a local new yorker advised thats why we use cabs. im super uber inclines hence my writing this complaint. that guy was extremely unprofessional, to say the least. either hes hateful, having a bad day, or in appropriate to work for your company.
MSG|2246| the drivers app(vehicle) was circling for several minutes while i waited to order another car. i just canceled to reorder another ride. after i canceled it said driver was on the way and drivers vehicle was still spinning - i was outside with service and im positive it was not my service or data connection causing the disconnect. thank you.
MSG|2247| driver said i wasnt showing on his app and i must share my ride with another person driver was going to pick up
MSG|2248| please switch $5.00 payment to credit card 4874
MSG|2249| the driver took long than expected and he picked up another passenger before me
MSG|2250| why am i  getting  charged  11.92 forward  a trip  i  cancelled  in  time it  doesn't  make  sense  and  it's  unfair i'm  really  disappointed  in  uber
MSG|2251| the driver never picked us up and he kept driving to our destination. i called him and stated where we were and where we were going and he just said ok ok and hung up the phone. could i please be reimbursed as now i have to request another ride.
MSG|2252| when i was ordering my trip the app was saying i was on the way. hadnt even been picked up yet. cancelled and got same driver. she said it was her error somehow. within a few minutes i had tge same driver.
MSG|2253| the driver picked up a different person and drove away so i had to cancel the ride
MSG|2254| no
MSG|2255| the uber driver felix was accepted my ride and then never moved from his location upon two attempts. i was only credited for one 5 dollar fee when i was charged for two 5 dollars cancellation fee. apparently the driver was waiting in the area to see who else would request an uber. this is very unprofessional. i need to be refunded for both my cancellation fees. why would he accept my ride the second time if he knew he wasnt going to accept the ride and wait around. when i called him he claim say he was dropping someone off when it clearly shows he didnt have any customers in his vehicle. im very disappointed with his services.
MSG|2256| if i was charged i want my damn money back,  i had to call for a nother car, which i'm in currently. youressahe said something bout a payment problem, i'm using the same card i would have used on that ride.
MSG|2257| i requested this pickup with the correct pickup address. the app said my driver was nearby and 6 minutes away. after a few minutes i checked the app again and the driver was traveling in the opposite direction and did not display a wait time for my pickup. i called the driver and he said he was 20 minutes away, but my view within the app made it appear as if he had picked me up and we were in the middle of my ride. it was very bizarre. i asked the driver to cancel my trip. i do not feel that i should be charged this $9 fee as it was clearly a malfunction of the app or possibly a user-error on the drivers end. please refund me. thank you
MSG|2258| it said the driver was 2 minutes away but never arrived, the arrival time started to increase and as we waited i then noticed it said on trip but the driver never came to pick us up. i ended up canceling because it appeared someone else must have taken the trip.
MSG|2259| we had 6 people picking up from airport and we couldn't fit in vehicle
MSG|2260| pick up dress was marked as drop off as well
MSG|2261| the driver dont show up and he didnt answer my call so i cancelled and try to schedule another one . need to refund the cancellation fee .
MSG|2262| my driver asked me to cancel. he said it would take 20 minutes. he said cancel it and you wont be charged.
MSG|2263| i requested an uber upon my arrival at jfk. as i was tracking my ride, it said it arrived at sign 5. i was at sign 3 walking to my car and upon arrival at sign 5 there were two toyota camrys, neither matching the license plate on my app. the driver then started my ride while i was still standing in the cold with my mother and child looking for my uber. i then cancelled and requested another one. i dont want to be charged a cancellation fee or half of my ride since i never got in the car
MSG|2264| driver was heading in wrong direction
MSG|2265| wrong adress
MSG|2266| i was supposed to be charged $4.49 for my trip but was charged $7.98 instead. midway through my trip my driver asked me to cancel the trip as he was having issues with his app. i followed his instructions as he noted that his phone was not functioning properly. i would like for me fee to be adjusted to $4.49 as agreed when i ordered the trip.
MSG|2267| i called to confirm if my driver could give me a ride to east bay. he said no and continued to tell me that i need to cancel on my end and i said no i believe either party could cancel. he said i was wrong and i that was the way uber works. we went into this discussion for a while but his behavior is unacceptable. he clearly was trying to not get a bad rating but instead was rude about telling me how uber works. i want to report this driver for his behavior.
MSG|2268| i cancelled my trip right away. driver was 8 min away. didnt want to wait so long.
MSG|2269| i hadnt even gotten to the destination i had to walk to when the uber driver seemed to have started the trip
MSG|2270| i had to cancel because it would not allow me to change destination. the driver tried as well and we could not get the destination to change. this fee is unjust.
MSG|2271| someone else must have gotten in the uber i ordered as the car was shown as driving the route i had ordered (and the trip was started) without me in the car
MSG|2272| i ordered the uber. my son and i walked three minutes in the rain to the meeting point. the uber driver should have been the one minute after us. the uber driver acknowledged  my initial communication that my son and i were walking to the pickup point.  the uber driver ignored my further attempts at contact. agyer waiting 9 minutes in the rain called explaining that my phone was at 2% battery and described what my son and i were wearing.  after one more minute of waiting, i cancelled the uber,  went into a nearby establishment to order another uber and charge my phone. during the 10 minute wait i continued to watch the map on the uber app and i saw that the driver never left the wendy's area. my phone currently has water in it due to being used in the rain. do not pair me with that driver again.
MSG|2273| my driver told me to cancel because the trip was wrong we got it right and we are on the ride now
MSG|2274| this driver had another person to pick up but ended up moving away from us going the opposite way
MSG|2275| my driver even did not pick me up and app showed that i am in my way to destination address. something wrong with your app. please give me refund
MSG|2276| i was charged a head for my trips you never refund my money back on my credit card for 3 incidence
MSG|2277| i requested this trip, was walking towards the pick up location when i realized joan had already picked someone up under my name. i attempted to call her but she didnt answer. i did not take this trip. i took the bus instead.
MSG|2278| i was waiting for 6 mins and driver was still in same stop. i want my 3.09 back
MSG|2279| driver canceled the trip
MSG|2280| the car didnt match the description. the uber driver texted me red honda as soon as the ride was placed and canceled
MSG|2281| this was a incorrect drop off location i was trying to be picked up at wawa and dropped off at applebees it picked me up at american crab and took me to a wawa that i didnt know where i was at and i had to to cancel the ride and now and which im late to work
MSG|2282| he took over 30 min and still did not arrive, i will now be late to work
MSG|2283|  
MSG|2284| someone that was a female got in my uber and the uber driver pulled off
MSG|2285| someone else took it.
MSG|2286| this ride was cancelled due the driver having personal issues with the rider. she wouldnt cancel but refused to pick me up. i was told i would get reimbursed for this trip.
MSG|2287| switch to card ending in 1532
MSG|2288| uber took $11 dollars off of my card when the trips keep canceling, i need my full refund back on that trip that was never on its way, thanks!
MSG|2289| this trip was cancelled because this was not the driver in the picture. i would like my money back.
MSG|2290| i called this uber it said 5 mins stayed at 5 mins then went up to 6 mins then went back to 5 mins and stayed there again so i canceled and had to make other plans
MSG|2291| he looked at me drove past me and left the area without picking me up i should not be charged
MSG|2292| demanded documentation even after i educated him on the law and ubers policy. you can check his lies in our conversation by text
MSG|2293| i was looking forward long for my driver for almost 5 minutes, which is way longer than uber pool should take, and then the diver suddenly canceled. i then had to order a regular uber, which cost me $4 more than it should have. i am very unhappy.
MSG|2294| i did not receive a receipt for this trip. was i charged for it?
MSG|2295| driver picked up someone else. i called him and he dropped the other people off.i should not be charged for a trip the driver was taking someone else. this driver picked up simeine else and then blamed me.
MSG|2296| driver indicated they picked me up right away so i canceled and they did it again. ended up taking an uber x instead...
MSG|2297| hi, so my ride had 2 stops right, so i got dropped off at my 1st stop and the driver starts the route for my 2nd stop and drive off( i know cause it alerted me on my phone and i seen it) and he doesnt wait for me at all, he literally was driving to my next stop which was my home and i was like why tf is he driving to my final stop without me so i canceled my ride and i had to get a whole new ride and spend more money because of it
MSG|2298| the trip did take place but driver never ended the trip after dropping at airport, reason why i had to cancel.
MSG|2299| driver would pick me up at curb and made me get in on the street in front of traffic. when i told him that was unacceptable, he continued to dispute and when i asked him to please stop talking so that i could have peace and quiet, he also refused and continued trying to talk to me. so i asked to get out.
MSG|2300| my driver never arrived. the trip started and then it ended. i want a refund.
MSG|2301| no
MSG|2302| my uber was taking to long
MSG|2303| the driver picked up someone else and left me at airport. i will not pay this fee
MSG|2304| i asked who is uber was for and he refused to tell me because he wanted my friends and i to get in the car. he said  no i dont do that when i saw the uber app on his phone in the car. i cancelled the uber because my friend from south carolina was murdered for getting into an uber and not asking who it was for. i demand my money back. thank you
MSG|2305| someone else got into my uber so i had to cancel. i am now late to where im supposed to be
MSG|2306| i required the wrong destination thats why i canceled it and he was less then 2 mins away so hey got there before
MSG|2307| hola, yo cancel mi viaje y me baj porque me equivoqu de direccin y me estn cobrando casi 10 dlares lo eso, cuando lo que se tiene cobrar son 5
MSG|2308| 
MSG|2309| driver was not at correct location in very inclement weather
MSG|2310| uber wont work for some reason uber x it keeps saying all drivers are busy ? is there anyway to fix it
MSG|2311| please refund this entire trip. the driver did not know where he was going to pick up the second rider. i got out of the uber and had to call another uber to get to my destination
MSG|2312| this driver kept driving away from me. he wouldnt pick up the phone. i stood waiting for over 15 mins and your app makes it difficult to cancel. you should add a way to report these issues. your drivers accept trips while driving on other companies and waste our (customers) time. also you keep having a cancellation fee while having no control over your drivers
MSG|2313| the car was banged up pretty bad
MSG|2314| he was abusive and blamed me for not typing the address that i never have to do
MSG|2315| driver never picked me up. app says i was charged. please refund the charge.
MSG|2316| the ride canceled by itself and still charged me
MSG|2317| my driver called me to tell me there was a parade on bergenline ave its been 30 minutes already since we requested the uber i politely asked him to cancel and he refused he said whenever he get to me he will do it so i should wait , please i am requesting to not get a cancelation fee
MSG|2318| it was out of state driver didn't know. he didn't want to take the trip
MSG|2319| the driver said to cancel the ride since he needed to go to the gas station
MSG|2320| i didnt ride on uber but driver clicked on confirm pickup  maybe miss him so please charge back cancellation fee
MSG|2321| my uber driver never showed up but excepted the ride. when i tried to contact him he did not answer
MSG|2322| i was charged for a trip i didnt take
MSG|2323| uber driver did not pick me up and started the trip before picking me up
MSG|2324| i ordered the uber and the driver never came in my direction. then he started the ride and i was never picked up and he never came my way and that is why i cancelled. he was going a complete different way and then started the trip. would like a refund please
MSG|2325| he just didnt care
MSG|2326| he was rude and bitter. canceled on him twice for the same reason.
MSG|2327| he refused to pick me up.
MSG|2328| never picked me up in correct place. made me run after him and meet him by a sketchy ally when hen i am a single woman, he also spoke on the phone the whole time
MSG|2329| driver never met me & decided to put ride in progress so we were unable to find each other & i had to cancel.
MSG|2330| i was in the middle of an uber ride home when i asked the driver if he could take a different route which was faster. he pulled over and kicked me out of his car. saying that it was his ride and he would not allow me in the car. kicked me out of the ride in the middle of the street. i have never experienced this.
