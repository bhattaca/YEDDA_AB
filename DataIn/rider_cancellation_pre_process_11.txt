MSG|1669| he didn't pick up me but i already paid out uber fee i don't know why i have to pay cancel fee
MSG|1670| i ordered an uber xl. got the uber x. had to cancel because the driver wouldn't take the extra person.
MSG|1671| the app showed me driving to minneapolis and wouldnt allow me to change it after trying 10 times i had to cancel the trip. i should not be charged for this . i was going to 644 n lakeshore drive chicago not minnesota
MSG|1672| my driver did not pick me up he picked up someone else and i had to cancel. i need a refund for this
MSG|1673| im a gold member and it says if i cancel a trip and book another right away i wont be charged a cancellation fee
MSG|1674| i could not cancel within a minute as my phone malfunctioned. i texted driver to cancel it and he waited until cancellation fee was higher. i watched as the cancellation fee increased and he did not cancel it. this driver stole money from me.
MSG|1675|23 pm the driver still didnt arrive i texted the driver no answer. so i cancelled && requested a new ride after waiting another 2-5 minutes i was given the same driver who still took forever to pick me up i tried to cancel again but i was notified a 3.50 cancellation fee. so long story short i waited for this driver for 20 minutes in the beaming hot sun and made it to work late, i would like a refund for this.
MSG|1676| hi i dont understand why i was charded the full amount not even just a cancellation fee! i was just charged! the car was taking too long it was not far i want a full refund please!
MSG|1677| my driver pick up someone else and pulled off as i was waving
MSG|1678| the driver drove past me and i had to run out after him on the street. i was waving him down with my red marker but he still drove past, once i caught up with him he refused to let me load my bags. he said my luggage was too big and i wouldnt fit even though i was a single rider and the luggage could have fit easily. he then drove off and did not cancel the ride for a few minutes after he left even though he said he wouldnt give me a ride. he was very unprofessional and i was embarrassed in front of a large crowd and close group of friends. thank you for taking the time to read this as i would only write it for a true issue.
MSG|1679| it said i am in the car and on the way to the destination but i am not and i just canceled it.
MSG|1680| my drive went to the wrong location and could not find me i should not be charged a fee
MSG|1681| driver refused to lock me up. said it would take too long. i have screen shots of his txt.
MSG|1682| i got into uber as it was cancelled. kept trying to request to sync up with driver.  took many tries hence the cancellations.
MSG|1683| the driver confirmed the pick-up as if i was in the car on my way to my destination but i was never in car which is why i cancelled the trip and i am still being charged for the ride.
MSG|1684| the driver before this cancelled on me. he was driving hyundai genesis. prior to getting to my destination, he messaged me and asked me where i was going and when i replied, he cancelled on me. please make sure his ratings/compensation gets reflected for this. thank you
MSG|1685| hi, this happens way too often, the driver asked me to cancel twice, could you please give me my refund immediately
MSG|1686| he was moving away from my location
MSG|1687| i requested an uber pool. but my driver never picked me up. and i was charged for the ride and a cancelation fee.
MSG|1688| i couldnt find the driver
MSG|1689| i didnr take this trip and rge time didnt start for tge driver ro xome my way i want my loney back asap
MSG|1690| if you see the map he never come to my pickup point. he was lost. i called him and never answer. i canceled the trip
MSG|1691| the ber driver never picked me up for my destination. he instead waited at a parking lot and would not answer my calls. i had no choice but to leave the trip open and order a lyft. i refuse to pay for an uber ride that i never got and he never came to my destination.
MSG|1692| uber had a 1.5 star average review and did not move towards me.did not pick me up.
MSG|1693| he was yelling at me through the phone and he continued to drive off without me and still charged the ride i want all my money back i never got into the car!!
MSG|1694| i called an uber for my friends to go to the airport. the trip was cancelled on the uber drivers app and my friends sat on the side of the road for 15-20 minutes because the driver didnt want to drive without insurance. after calling the drivers support line, my friends were taken to their stop. the app then adjusted the fare and charged me for a completed uninterrupted trip. ive spent about 45 minutes dealing with something that should have been simple and feel that miking me pay the full fare is an insult in addition to the inconvenience. please correct this issue.
MSG|1695| i was never in this car even though the app said i was.
MSG|1696| someone stole my trip
MSG|1697| someone stole my trip
MSG|1698| i was charged a trip and never picked up!
MSG|1699| my driver never picked me up but turned the meter on so i had to cancel
MSG|1700| driver opened the trip before picking me up to see the location where i was going
MSG|1701| it was charged twice. i believe it was because i had requested, then canceled but the application crashes after that. then i requested again and it paid 2 trips for one
MSG|1702| was the same previous driver that i canceled before because i was to distant.
MSG|1703| hello! i never went to my destination.
MSG|1704| i called him twice and he sent me to voice mail then came to my pick up spot all crazy sledding and called me, when u asked if that was him he said just get in the car, i opened the door and he wouldnt even confirm his name and said close the door
MSG|1705| no but i would like a refund of $11.23 since i did not take this trip because it was not the correct license plate
MSG|1706| refused destination
MSG|1707| cobrar na minha conta a viagem .. quero devoluo .. obrigado
MSG|1708| thats a scam
MSG|1709| driver was 1 minute away and drove further, until he was 10 minutes from me
MSG|1710| he left me in the rain. the wait went from 5 minutes then 7 minute then he wasnt moving for almost 10! i should be charged a cancellation fee since i was in the rain. please confirm thank you
MSG|1711| the car was a different model and color than the one shown on my app. it also had a different license plate number and the driver did not speak enough english to explain why his car was different than what was shown on my app. the inconsistencies made my friends and i apprehensive and we did not feel comfortable getting into the car.
MSG|1712| the location pickup was very far and the car did not move
MSG|1713| my driver did not show up, started the trip and never arrived. ive been waiting et the airport in a country i dont live in. i want a full refund for this inconvenience and because i was never picked up in the first place. thank you
MSG|1714| i would just like to know why i used uber the night before at that location as well as my coworkers and had no problems with my location. i was running late for a business meeting and i use uber often. i understand i should check the pin drop but i have no idea where this driver was or where you pinned my location. i tried to get in contact with him to get him in rout with me and was willing to pay whatever at that point because i was late. but his phone cut out and i could not get a connection with him in a clear line to get him to my address. i kept trying to give him my address and between the bad phone service and his very little understanding of english there was no way to get him to me. i dont believe i should be charged for this fee. i had to go in to the hotel and luckily the shuttle service got me to my meeting. but i was 15 minutes late. i shouldve had plenty of time to make an 8 am meeting when i first called for your uber.
MSG|1715| charged $20 fee , the driver left me .... i wasnt even 3 minutes long.
MSG|1716| the driver circled downtown for 10 minutes. i called him and he said he was lost. i have a flight to catch.
MSG|1717| driver didnt move towards my location, or sths wrong with uber app, so pls refund
MSG|1718| imported $50 of uber cash into my account before check went through.... now that my check went through the payment is still declining and i have unnecessary charges to my card
MSG|1719| hi, i am unable to request an uber. please explain why
MSG|1720| she had press the start trip thing on her app so she couldn't even be directed to where i was which see wasted twenty minutes of my time deliberately so after that long process of her not moving her to car to follow the directions i told on the phone i canceled since she just didn't move her car and follow directions she acted in a very unprofessional manner.
MSG|1721| i never took the ride, by the time i got downstairs, he had already left and someone else had already taken the ride
MSG|1722| i have 2 pending charges for drivers that accpeted my request then canceled   1 amount for $18.50 1 amount for $18.93  that's fraud  i need these charges rescinded quickly
MSG|1723| driver drove past me i called he said he was coming back i waited he went in circles i called back to see if he was lost and needed directions he hung up on me called back told me to cancel so i did and had to request another ride my $3 needs to be refunded as well as my new trip fee needs to be adjusted to the $5.85 i should also get something for inconvenience of me wasting my time waiting so long and will now be late!
MSG|1724| i never cancelled and the system manipulated the ride i ordered to include surge pricing which never showed up for me and i never agreed to it
MSG|1725| hey i have a question. i get the cancelation fee thing and all. but when i put a ride in whats the time i should wait before the person starts to drive. this has happened before many times i dont get why the driver would accept the ride and not drive in a timely fashion. its odd to me. thank you! sorry about this.
MSG|1726| the app told me it was unable to locate my ride and that there were no cars available. i wasnt even in the app and all of a sudden it said i had a ride three minutes away
MSG|1727| this is ridiculous. im paying for him to pick me up directly in an area unknown instead he's still attempting to pick me.up not in.the location specified and then refuses to contact me or answer my phone calls to alert me of where he is
MSG|1728| i was charged for the trip that i never took
MSG|1729| i ran after the driver and caught him. told him to wait for other passengers and drove off
MSG|1730| driver did not pick me up and started the trip like he picked me up then just drove away, i have screenshots showing him driving away, so i had to cancel and got another uber car, i need this $10.20 refunded
MSG|1731| my driver started the trip without picking me up and just drove away and now i am requesting another ride please refund the fee asap
MSG|1732| yes
MSG|1733| it kept saying the driver was 2 minutes away after two minutes i waited 15 minutes and no one showed up .
MSG|1734| driver took off with other passengers in the car so i had to cancel for that reason
MSG|1735| my driver was sitting in a lot of traffic because of a graduation and just told me to cancel because he was taking over 20 mins. so i dont want to receive a cancellation fee for that
MSG|1736| i know you don't care because you are a billion dollar business but you literally are the worst. credit me for every trip i have ever taken.... waiting 20 minutes when it says 3. terrible routes. the worst gps ever. how the fuck did you people sleep at night. no morals. no respect. a leach to society. fuck uber
MSG|1737| when i tried requesting the trip, i kept getting a something went wrong message so i then went on to use lyft because i kept getting that message... next thing i know i get a notification from uber saying my driver was there but by that point i no longer was there. i never got notified that my trip was booked or anything, so i had to cancel
MSG|1738| i did not cancel trip.. i did cancel return trip.. my fare is $31.00 i was dropped off at 43-32 kissena ave..i paid for one way trip from 30-30 northern blvrd to 43-32 kissena..
MSG|1739| driver never picked me up!
MSG|1740| why did you charge my credit card $122+ for a trip i didnt take?  two of your drivers refused my trip because it  was too far, but you charged my credit card anyway? why?
MSG|1741| the xl i ordered was a 4 seater coupe. infiniti q60 isnt an suv
MSG|1742| i would like a credit for what i paid on my last trip. my driver cancelled unexpectedly and it was hard finding a new uber which caused me to pay a higher price and i missed my train because of this.
MSG|1743| i requested a ride the uber driver never picked me up i contacted him over 4 times now i cant get a uber home
MSG|1744| driver dont pick me up
MSG|1745| emergency shut down at my daughters school which blocked us from leaving the school the driver wouldnt of been able to enter the area so i requested a cancellation to prevent more delays
MSG|1746| please call me. 6094720904 i was charged for 2 trips that did not go through and want a refund immediately
MSG|1747| well you dont give a dispute option for cancellations so i dont know that i got charged but i sat here waiting for six minutes and the driver didnt move at all i said the ride would be here in 5. its just unacceptable i rely on uber to get me to work and back i can be late
MSG|1748| driver never picked me up
MSG|1749| driver did not end the trip and drove up to paterson, nj. it should have ended at newark airport.
MSG|1750| i call the driver 7 times and he didnt care about picking me up why should i pa y the cancellation fee he never answer the phone
MSG|1751| my driver was on course for over 20 minutes when stated he was 5 minutes away the entire time
MSG|1752| he said he was 1 minute away, then got farther and farther away. i needed to get to my destination at a specific time, i dont want someone to tell me theyre close then go farther away before they get me, and i shouldnt pay a cancellation fee for that.
MSG|1753| i was charged for this cancelled trip for about $10 . i want a refund
MSG|1754| my uber driver never got to the place to pick me up he didnt move at all, and said he didnt know how to get there and i explained him, but still he didnt show up to pick me up. very bad service!!
MSG|1755| he didnt show
MSG|1756|  5.89   4  uber
MSG|1757| we ordered an xl and they sent a regular car. we could not fit 6 so had to cancel. we had to use lyft because uber kept sending the same non xl- please cancel my fee.
MSG|1758| now
MSG|1759| i was outside and driver left i texed him i was outside
MSG|1760| my pickup location was not the same as my gps location. had to cancel to reset. i should not be charged a fee for this. thanks
MSG|1761| this guy started the trip before i was even in the car!! he replied to me at first in a different language which i realized said he arrived. i messaged him stating exactly where i was and that he wasn't here. he said he was at the entrance but he was not. tried calling and he wouldn't answer.  i never got in his vehicle he never should have started the trip.
MSG|1762| my driver made me wait over 7 minutes and never showed up making me miss a job interview.  im furious
MSG|1763| it had me on uber pool express i dont ride that i cant walk far
MSG|1764| someone else took my uber and my driver drove off, so i had to cancel the trip
MSG|1765| on the app it doesnt show that i have a cancellation fee. but on my credit card statement i was charged $5.
MSG|1766| never came
MSG|1767| driver and i couldn't connect via app once i got into a car
MSG|1768| the driver did not pick me up. he picked someone else and when i call him, he did not answer me.
MSG|1769| refund cancelation fee to credit card
MSG|1770| this driver was very unprofessional and didnt drive me because i was too far.
MSG|1771|\n- the drivers have become rude and unprofessional. they dont respond nicely, cancel a lot and are unable to follow the directions most of the time. \n- the pickup / drop off points for pool / express pool have turned into long (extremely long) walking distances. \n- the waiting times are always miscalculated. \n- theres no ride pass or discounts that are being offered to the active users anymore. \n- the rates are insanely high many times. even lyft is charging less than uber for the same route. i have been doing the same route since last year but now it has raised to $2 - $3 every time. \nplease dont reply me saying that we are looking to improve our gps, eta, drivers, or service / app in general. i get that email almost every other day. i am really looking forward to a good change. thanks!
MSG|1772| you sent me an email confirming his ill behavior; why am being charged $4.25 for this? do you think i am lieng on what your uber driver said to me? i use uber everyday and make sure to compliant whenever anything goes wrong. you are not letting me proceed forward in the app? i can surely delete and let go of the app if you dont want me to be your customer anymore.
MSG|1773| what the hell is wrong with uber?? this driver, he didnt even stop at the pickup point, he kept moving, i called him to pick me up, and he said no i am not picking you up, i didnt see you?!! he was so stubborn, i told him to cancel it if he is not picking up but he said no i wont even cancel! i think he was drunk or something! i dont expect this behavior from uber. as well as, i am noticing this weird increase in the rates on the same route that i have been taking throughout the year. it was always $3-4, sometimes when traffic is extremely exceptional, it would go upto 4 point something, but now its mostly higher than 5 and beyond! (for express pool) , the pickups and drop off points have become so long, absolutely hating the app and experience now.
MSG|1774| i scheduled ride. driver called me after allottedtime. said he is at mechanic shop & cannot make it. i cancel ride & now im charged 3 dollars. please adjust this correctly and credit my debit card 3 dollars
MSG|1775| this driver just cancelled my trip without telling me or arriving to pick me up?  what the heck?!?!  this is not the first time this has happened.
MSG|1776| i had to cancel this trip due to my driver starting the trip about 5 blocks from my location and then went to pick up co riders and i was charged 8.06 for a ride i never took and had to re order a uber.
MSG|1777| was going to do something thats why icancel and dont noticed they going to charge me for that
MSG|1778| driver lost
MSG|1779| 
MSG|1780| you guys updated my charge for a driver that didnt show up. he was showing 7 min away and after waiting 20 min i contacted him and never received a response. i am disputing the entire fee especially since i took a select ride. completely ridiculous. if you choose not to fix this i will never use uber again.
MSG|1781| my drivers car did not have enough seats available for 5 people even though i requested an xl. one of the seats was malfunctioning and was not able to properly be set up to seat a person. the uber driver claimed that he wasnt able to cancel my ride, and requested i cancel it so he can take other riders. i did so to help the driver out, but was wrongly charged for a ride that was not what i requested and that i never got on. would kindly appreciate to have a full refund, thank you.
MSG|1782| driver refused my trip
MSG|1783| my destination drop off was wrong
MSG|1784| this driver took so long to be my pick up location, i didn't want to wait for that long, it showed me that he would be arrived around 5 min which was not correct, i just got off work, why i couldn't choose a right rider. it's ridiculous, i thought your driver finally got improved quality but it seemed still disappointed. i would like to refund for this cancellation fee
MSG|1785| the driver never arrived at the pickup point i was never picked up but on the app it shows he picked me up i never took the ride so i shouldnt have to pay for it my card shouldnt have been charged to cancel a ride i need a refund in full amount back to my card
MSG|1786| my car is 15 minutes out. the app charge me $5 and its inaccurate. the car its in another town
MSG|1787| i pressed cancel by a mistake instead i wanted to report my driver i hope i wasnt charged a cancellation fee
MSG|1788| i was charged $3.29 on my last trip for canceling. my driver never picked me up and i was notified that i was picked up and on my way. before that, i was left waiting for a ride that never came and then canceled after i had waited and walked to the location to be picked up. i wasnt charged but after two cancellations i had to pay for a more costly ride due to not having enough time to get to my destination otherwise.
MSG|1789| i have 5 minutes to cancel.
MSG|1790| my driver was holding his phone in his left hand so he could look at the map. i told him that was very unsafe and when he insisted upon doing it i got out of the car
MSG|1791| driver was unprofessional
MSG|1792| not driver never pick me up had me waiting 20 minutes!
MSG|1793| my driver never showed up... it was 11pm and i was not willing to stand outside and wait for him due to safety concerns. hope we can refund the 5 dollars!
MSG|1794| my card was charged 25 dollars????? how do you not have a phone number
MSG|1795| i contacted the driver numerous times by text and phone. he didn't pick me up and refused to cancel the trip.
MSG|1796| my driver never picked me up - he clicked the button stating he did on the app, but i was still waiting outside as he drove away. when i realized he wasn't coming back for me,  i cancelled the trip. i've been charged a fee for a service that never happened.
MSG|1797| please change to my personal credit card ending in 1015
MSG|1798| i need a call back immediately. uber has my funds and i need a driver
MSG|1799| my drivers pick up was farther than the app said
MSG|1800| i got removed from the ride. could see the ride but i wasn't a pickup anymore. driver did not pick up any of my two phone calls
MSG|1801| someone else went into the car before me and the driver took them. i canceled right away and order another car. please make sure not to charge me for this one
MSG|1802| couldnt find sorry
MSG|1803| my driver refused my destination - this is a constant issue. i want my uber cash refunded. i wont be needing it.
MSG|1804| no driver ever arrived
MSG|1805| the driver refused my trip.
MSG|1806| i was there waiting and it still shows 8 mins when i had to walked 5 mins which is more than the usual walk distance plus you guys charging me $9.20 for what?! im sick and tired of you guys robbing me my money and if you guys refused i will file a claim again and again like stop robbing poor people their honest earning money.
MSG|1807| the car broke down and all the 3 passengers had to be vacated.
MSG|1808| he called me to make sure i wasnt going on a direction he was going in because he couldnt take me to maryland
MSG|1809| someone got in my uber and i was charged even though my uber driver never picked me up. i would like to be refunded for this trip.
MSG|1810| the driver picked someone else up and drove off. app says i have not been charged but i have just had an email come through with the charge.
MSG|1811| i and my wife waited for him share ride meeting place over half an an hour. he just circled around between terminal 1 and terminal 2. i called him several tine&left the message.he didnt answer and didnt call me back. it seemed he didnt wanna do his  job with us& i think its unprofessional behavior. if i can write his review i think i have to give him 0star. because he made us wait there over 30min. it was really cold.
MSG|1812| the driver cancelled my ride.  why was i charged?
MSG|1813| the driver said she can't take me to my destinations because it was too far and she has reached her 10hrs but didn't know how to cancel it and was wasn't my time because i had to pick up my child and head to work so i canceled it. pls refund my money. thx
MSG|1814| vehicle reeked of smoke
MSG|1815| my driver never showed up and did not answer any messages or calls.
MSG|1816| it said he picked somebody up that wasnt me in the car i tried calling and he didnt answer and i was charged for a order that i didnt take which in unfair .
MSG|1817| i'm still waiting for my credit for this ride to be returned to me ?
MSG|1818| the driver never picked me up and drove in the opposite direction. i had to cancel the trip and took a taxi instead
MSG|1819| the pulled up to me, did a u turn and left. i called 3 times and was sent to voice mail each time. i left a message and got no call back.
MSG|1820| lisa messaged  me that had to stop to get gas after taking my ride. i hope i don't have to pay. i spend a lot of money with uber. i downloaded the lyft app and only had to wait 2 minutes until that driver picked me up. thanks for listening.
MSG|1821| my uber literally left us as we were going to get into the car. i dont get the point of using this app.
MSG|1822| he never showed up
MSG|1823| good morning\nim having trounble using my uner credits that i purcjaaed from a godt card. when im requesting a ride, it charges me a higher price and does not regard my uber credits balance...
MSG|1824| i was charged for this whole fee instead of just a cancellation fee. i reported it and was told my money will be refunded back into my account since i never rode in the car. however, i still have not been refunded the money.
MSG|1825| showed him necessary papers..
MSG|1826| he was extremely rude and demanded to see my esa badge which by law youre not supposed to do. he should not be driving.
MSG|1827| he refused to take 4 people in his car and was really disrespectful to me!!
MSG|1828| we scheduled a ride for sfo for 4 people. the car we  chose said 1-4 people and we put sfo as a destination so it's clear people will have luggage. we didn't worry because only 2 of 4 of us had checked luggage, the other 2 had only carry-ons. anyway, the driver arrived and we packed into the car without any issues. 5 minutes onto the trip the driver stopped and got out of the car and said passengers and luggage are too heavy for his car and he will not take us. i don't know how we assessed that since everyone was comfortable and all suitcases were in the trunk. we were shocked and in a hurry, we had to get out of the car, and find another uber asap since we needed to get to the airport at certain time and we just lost 30min. fortunately, another uber was 10min away (uberxl chevrolet suburban 29457b2) and he took us safely to the airport, but i was so scared that a regular car won't take us, that i got uber xl for $41 more although i shouldn't have to do that if a car indicates he can take 4 people to the airport. i was charged $5.95 for a canceled ride although it was the first driver (khong) who canceled the trip on us. i request a refund of $5.95 and also a refund of the difference i needed to pay for the 2nd ride (180-139=$41). this is unacceptable and was  very stressful for all of us and we were late to the airport by over 45min since the delay also added to an increased traffic. paulina
MSG|1829| i shouldnt have to pay the fee because my driver started my ride and i wasnt in the car
MSG|1830| the price changed
MSG|1831| i was charged more than it said for the trip and it says i cancelled the trip but i didnt, the driver dropped me off at my destination. confused as to why it says i cancelled and charged me more
MSG|1832| driver never picked me and up and said that she did and started the ride. please refund
MSG|1833| my driver never picked me up but the ride continued as if he had. i canceled after realizing the trip was going on even though i was not in the car.
