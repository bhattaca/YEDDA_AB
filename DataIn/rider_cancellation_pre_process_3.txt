MSG|337| i want my money back.she was too slow .she waste my time .she picked up wrong location to co rider
MSG|338| this lady accepts my ride and she never pick me up at all so i need me a refund
MSG|339| he never moved for 5-10 minutes
MSG|340| the driver kept going further from the pick up location and it reflects as if she was detouring some where else
MSG|341| the driver started the ride, but he had not picked me up. so i cancelled the trip and requested another trip, where the same driver picked me up. the driver claimed that the app glitches and he accidentally started the trip without me in the car. please refund me.
MSG|342| my driver turned and started driving in the other direction and the wait time started to reverse. i have a screen shot to share.
MSG|343| he never even picked us up, i called twice and he never answered the phone and was not located at our location. i saw he clicked that we got in the car when we never entered it and now have to order another one. incredibly unprofessional and unsafe
MSG|344| my driver and i could not connect.  please refund my cancellation fee
MSG|345| trip included multiple stop seemed not to go in the correct way, tried to cancel and put stops in correctly. did not work. the driver should be paid. the $29.85. it was taking from my bank account
MSG|346| my driver when matched was 1 minute away. he ended up driving away from me. by the time i had to cancel, he didnt respond to my message, he was more than half way to my destination. i should not be charged a cancellation. i would have been waiting forever. also the app should not allow an estimate of pick time more than quadrupled and never decrease and not matching the rider with a new driver.
MSG|347| i would like a refund that is being charged on my credit card. i didnt take this car.
MSG|348| []
MSG|349| i am allergic to cologne and air fresheners. i texted this to the driver. when i got in the car i  didnt realize he or the car had fragrance. i started smell it after a couple of blocks and opened the windows.    the driver advised me to cancel because it was a long trip
MSG|350| my eta said 1 min when the app said 5 min walk to destination and the car gps on the app keeps spinning the car. i want a refund.
MSG|351| my uber driver was 10 minutes away and was not making any progress towards my location which is why i cancelled. i should not be charged a cancelation fee for not wanting to wait extra time on an uber to make his way towards my location.
MSG|352| my account was charged twice for 10 dollars but i cancelled it for five
MSG|353| the driver accepts my trips but he doesnt seems like to come n i called him he just refuse to answer thats was so bad
MSG|354| i got a back problem and i need to seat on the front seat but driver refused and bad attitude. so cancel my trip.
MSG|355| i ordered this uber, i never got in it and the driver had put i got in the car. i was unfairly charged for a ride i didnt even take .
MSG|356| uber driver continue the drive after been dropped off
MSG|357| i wanted to complain about this driver yesterday but i lost my phone for 1 when he got me everything was cool then on the way to get the second co rider he almost side swiped a car then the second person gets in he cuts off a car with no signal we get to the second person  and as he driving he gets a third he tells  the second person  to get out when it was the third person pick up so now we waited passed the 2 mins he is allowed me and the 2nd girl is getting upset because the 3rd isn't there  yet . this whole trip was bad the driver was rude the driving was bad the 3rd corider was rude just bad experience
MSG|358| hi can i get a refund driver and i couldnt connect
MSG|359| i called him and told him that the app doesnt have my correct pick up location and ill sms my location to him i did and he drove right by me my boyfriend called and told him to turn around he did and went into a street and took forever to come out i missed my flight and had to rebook for the next day
MSG|360| uber did not show up. i do not expect to pay this fare. thank you.
MSG|361| my driver asked me to cancel the trip because he was stuck in traffic and i have evidence of the messages he sent me.
MSG|362| false
MSG|363| i didnt take this trip plus it was cancelled on my uber trip but the money still come out my bank account i need that  money back
MSG|364| the driver called me names and said he would find me and hurt me
MSG|365| would like my fare of $21.27 fully refunded.
MSG|366|15 am which i absolutely cannot miss. i waited a while and it is raining outside. i have to cancel as the driver was not moving at all. thats why i requested a full refund to my credit card. instead, i had to run in the rain and get a subway. please help with this issue.
MSG|367| i think the driver picked someone else up.  when i tried to contact them, they didnt respond.  so i cancelled without ever seeing him
MSG|368| he was really really rude, i asked if he is coming, he says you only wait for 3mins, i told him i have been waiting for more than 7mins, he hang up my phone.,  so i have to cancel and call another uber. very unprofessional and very rude
MSG|369| he took certainly way to long. i would like my refund. it said 7 minutes. i was waiting for 20 minutes. so i cancelled the ride.
MSG|370| i was unfairly charged a cancellation fee and i am upset because the driver never showed up but uet i got charged twice once for pick up and rhen for cancellation its lije he got paid to do nothing\n\nvery upsetting
MSG|371| when we seated inside the car driver app lost signal and he restarted his phone . after he turned his phone on it was showing that he has no rider in his car , his app was looking to find ride for him and he ask me to cancel because he had no other option that is why i cancel but during that time he was slowly moving and waiting for his phone to restart and he pulled over cross street so this trip never happened
MSG|372| hi there. i am a long-time uber customer with a very reliable history and reading. when i landed at lax today i called in huber pool which asked me to wait five minutes so that i could match with the driver. after five minutes nothing happened and it sent me back to the original landing page. this proceeded to happen to more times and i spent over 20 minutes simply trying to call an uber home. i ended up having to take a taxi cab which cost me over $50. after this experience i feel as if uber wasted not only my time but my money also. i would have taken lyft, but i have not downloaded it because i have always preferred uber but after this experience i might half to use lyft going forward. if there is any thing you could do such as reviewing my ride history to verify my story in the amount of time i spent simply trying to call an uber i would appreciate it.
MSG|373| ride was cancelled immediately
MSG|374| the driver did not come to the pick up location and he just indicated that he picked me up when i wasnt even in the car. i dont think i should be paying for a ride that i didnt even get
MSG|375| my driver called me to ask about my destination. after i told him that we are going back to sf he just disconnected his phone and cancelled the ride. this is not the level of service i expect.
MSG|376| how dare you charge me  for a driver who didnt show up!!!! i had a doctor appt and had to call an uber. refund me now!!! and i paid you $14.00 ! month for better treatment.  cancel my subscription.
MSG|377| ok so i ordered ride. the driver arrived and i got in his truck.  he said he had to cancel because it was too far. this is after he had accepted the trip. when i asked why he said because i did not state how far i was going. i told him he should know since it appears on his phone. he was very rude and asked me to get out. i have never been treated so rude. so i dont think i should have to pay anything since he was the one who said he couldn't take me. i was already inside his truck.  i really hope he was not being homophobic.  i am a television talk show host in houston and a news reporter visiting california for work. this man needs to not be an uber driver if he is going to be doing that to customers.
MSG|378| i accidentally was on the wrong level of the airport and the driver was yelling at me on the phone for being wrong and i said, i am coming upstairs right now. i apologize. please dont be rude and he said, ya know what i dont appreciate your attitude, and i said i just misunderstood the directions. i dont use uber very often. i see your car. i am walking to you now and he said, okay and drove off once i was near the car. i understand the right to refuse service but it was very intense and unnecessary. he had great reviews and i believe he felt that i was being rude which is what prompted his unprofessional actions, but i think he should have been a little bit more patient. it was a simple misunderstanding and a lack of ability to hear him clearly through the phone.
MSG|379| yelled and drove crazy
MSG|380| i do not like to complain about any driver, i appreciate them always, but this driver's age i felt made the pick up time alot longer then necessary and he could not hear me .
MSG|381| had to cancel to get another driver wait time stated 5 minutes called driver was told he needed 15 minutes to get to my location.
MSG|382| to know why i woke up to 3 different charges from uber. you guys already take pre-authorized payments for my account so nothing else should have been taken especially when i hadn't taken a ride since 12 a.m. these charges appeared at 9 and 10 a.m. i didn't take her eyes it doesn't show up on my trips so why the f*** are you taking my money
MSG|383| this driver (billy) accepted my fare, did not cancel and would not pick up the phone (i called him repeatedly to get an update on timing / location). i waited a good 10-15 mins before i had to cancel and order a replacement car.  this was inconsiderate and unprofessional behavior
MSG|384| my driver stopped across the street away from my pickup spot. i finally noticed his flashing lights. i waited for the light to turn green so that i can cross and he just sped off. he wasnt at my designated pick up area that i marked on my map. so i had to cancel since he didnt communicate with me why he was leaving. i called another car that is arriving.
MSG|385| they took the full amount for my ride even though i canceled the trip and i was stuck and late to work
MSG|386| 
MSG|387| driver literally didn't move according to app. restarted phone and refreshed network connection to be sure. have to be at work at 830 so cant risk and had to cancel.
MSG|388| when will i receive my refund
MSG|389| driver picked up a wrong person and then was not able to speak english to communicate. hence, i cancelled the ride and booked a new one but i dont know how will i receive the refund?
MSG|390|02am from the same scam artist driver. this driver started my trip the moment he took the ride. i was never in the car. i called to find him and he never answers his phone only texting me that there would be a $150 cancel fee. this is a lie and made me feel unsafe. i was not getting in the car with him. totally unacceptable!! i had no choice but to cancel the ride to get another driver and i got him again and he did the exact same thing to me. he is a scam artist and if both of these charges are not removed immediately i will be disputing with my credit card company. fire that driver he really made getting home last night difficult for me and im angry about all of this.
MSG|391| yes the driver was by my house to pick me up and drive in the opposite way to come pick me which just made me late work
MSG|392| the driver never picked us up, but somehow the ride started.  he was going towards our destination and not coming back so i cancelled and got a new driver.  htung came and picked us up and got us to the hilton.
MSG|393| driver got lost and accused us of moving.  said hes from san diego and so couldnt accept directions to destination.  seemed confused entering destination in gps.
MSG|394| i had to cancel my ride because the drivers app wasn't working and she didn't have directions. so i had to call another uber and i was charged a $5 cancellation fee
MSG|395| i did not take this trip
MSG|396| as i was walking towards where my driver was i waved at him to let him know i was his uber ride. i was about to open the car door when he sped up and drove away. i saw that he also had a passenger in his car. i dont remember opting for uber pool and quite friendly i felt extremely offended. never in my history of ubering has this ever happened it was very dangerous also how he sped up while i was reaching for the car door. this is absolutely unacceptable
MSG|397| i waited at the pick up point.  driver never showed and shows it was canceled by driver but her i was still charged.
MSG|398| driver made us enter two locations which doubles the price and then he lied and said he fixed the app and the after complaining he made us get out of the uber and wouldnt drive us any further
MSG|399| he picked up the wrong person, then didnt cancel the route for a while. which led to a charge. he wouldnt pick up my calls
MSG|400| jesus drove past me and went to the wrong pickup location. he then started circling and not coming toward me at all. i tried calling and he did not pick up. the whole experience was ridiculous. im in a lyft now.
MSG|401|30am in the morning i had to wait because he did not do his job. i had other options but since he accepted i sent them on. terrible service.
MSG|402| he drove off as i got to the car .. like a bitch...
MSG|403| i gave him instructions on how to bypass construction which he ignored, and then when i called he was aggravated about not being able to find me so i offered to cancel and he gave me attitude. not acceptable
MSG|404| driver picked up the wrong passenger right in front of me. should not be charged for cancellation. had to cancel after he picked up wrong passenger and drove away. called him. he did not answer phone.
MSG|405| on my last trip i waited for 20 minutes, and marcel the driver didn't show up. he was going the opposite direction. i texted him and asked him why he's going the wrong direction and he didn't respond. after 20 mins and being late for work i used lyft to get to work.\neventhough i i got a 5 dollar credit back, id like to report marcel s unprofessional behavior for wasting people's time. he was only three minutes away from my location and perhaps decided to take a different passenger with a different app, while making me wait.
MSG|406| driver kept going the wrong way
MSG|407| i received a text from my driver stating that he had arrived but i was not able to locate in the designated pick-up area. i thought i saw a car fitting the correct description, drive away and i text him to confirm this. next i heard a man yelling my name, but he was behind me and behind a gate in an area that was not approved for passenger pick-up (this was jfk airport).  i confirmed my identity and he gestured for me to cross the walk to the car. but instead of helping me with my bag he immediately began berating me of accusing him for driving off. i recanted my mistake and asked if we could leave since traffic was about to get bad. but his response was to question the names on my account and tell me that i delayed him due to missing a person. then he told me to catch another car, but that he would not cancel the trip. i understand that everyone has bad days and timeliness is always important; i too am a business owner and do i try to be conscious of these things. but there was absolutely no reason for him to raise his voice to such levels or address me with such disrespect, not just as a customer but as a fellow human. his aggressive behavior was such that after the incident, a couple walked over to ask me if i was okay. my fianc and i share this uber account and i do feel that if i was a man, he would not have addressed me in this way. he is also physically much larger than myself and for a moment i felt completely unsafe and overpowered. this incident is unacceptable in every way, all stemming from this drivers decision to pick-up from a location that was adjacent to the indicated pick up area. \n\nthank you for reviewing this message. i hope that no other customer will be made to feel the way i was today, by any uber driver.
MSG|408| my uber driver did not pick me up and began the trip as if they did.
MSG|409| i was waiting a while and didnt feel safe standing on the street alone so i got into a cab that was coming down the street instead to avoid standing alone in the dark.
MSG|410| driver didn't pick me up at my pick up spot then called me to ask my to walk multiple blocks to his car. this wasn't even a pool
MSG|411| the driver was driving away. the first time i cancelled and the second time i requested it was the same driver so i cancelled. why should i be charged of the cancellation fee?
MSG|412| hey i cant take an ive bc and advertisement something wrong. what is happening with my app?
MSG|413| this fee specifically
MSG|414| it said 11 mins and its over 11 mins and hes still picking up 2 people. i understand being late a few minutes but 12 mins after it said 11 minutes and hes still going in circles picking up 2 riders while i wait on the rain is not fair!
MSG|415| my driver wasn't coming towards me
MSG|416| i request for uber which is i am not is car and he start trip then he end the trip which is i was not there uber charge me 9$ something does not make sense please refund my money he should not start my teip unless i am not there thanx that time i was in rush thats why i did not report driver show respact
MSG|417| pickup location incorrect
MSG|418| this driver refused to come to my destination which was level 1 of the pickup area and he told me to cancel. he refused to cancel the trip himself. this was a waste of my time and i want my money back
MSG|419| the driver refused my destination and then refused to cancel because he didnt want to get a negative rating.
MSG|420| no i want my fucking 5 dollars back that driver made me late for work fuck the credit i want the cash she accepted the trip and never moved to get get the cancellation money
MSG|421| lady did not show up took over 30 minutes
MSG|422| there is a charge on my credit card for $43.04 for a ride that never happened. i would like a refund. please advise how to make this happen.
MSG|423| i hopped out of my ride early, which i told the driver. but i felt he purposely didnt end the trip to charge me full price. so i cancelled it because i didnt understand why the trip was still going when i hopped out
MSG|424| very mad how dare you
MSG|425| someone else prentended to be the driver
MSG|426| the driver never picked me up! i am still standing at my pick up location! how am i being charged if he did never picked me up!
MSG|427| you cancelled the car and sent me another driver....the wait time for the second driver was too long....i could not wait
MSG|428| car hit a curb and then got flat tire. thus trip cancelled
MSG|429| not waited even one min. i am about to reach car and she left
MSG|430| the driver was going the wrong way on map so i cancelled the ride under a minute. please refund me my money
MSG|431| my driver came and had no room for me and did not pick me up i want my full refund back to my card
MSG|432| i and driver couldnt find each other. i waited for couple of minutes and called as well. no response.
MSG|433| my driver messaged me before she got to me and was asking me to cancel the ride so she didnt have to. she said that if she ran out of gas after she got me that she was going to make me pay for it. felt unsafe
MSG|434| no
MSG|435| the driver tried to merge into a lane and side swiped an oncoming car
MSG|436| i was charged for the ride but the man never picked me up
MSG|437| well the uber driver didnt come to my pick point due to  the driver picking up a passenger and suppose to pick me up after she wind it up taken the previous pass her and left me and head it to the previous passenger destination and left me waiting for almost 25 minutes so i would like to get a full refund please.
MSG|438| my driver never picked me up. the app said that i was in the car but in reality i was still waiting for the driver at the initial address. i should not be getting charged for this.
MSG|439| i cancelled through google maps but it didnt go through.
MSG|440| hi i ordered the uber and accidentally cancelled but was charged in full. can it still come without charging my card again please?
MSG|441| my driver have left me did not notify me when he came and he was going around in circles looking at me and he drove  off i need to be refunded back asap
MSG|442| driver told me to cancel
MSG|443| i opened the uber door and ask the man who he was picking up (to verify that he was picking me up) im a girl, im alone, its night time, and i didnt think it was a ridiculous question to ask. he refused to tell me and says "are you coming in or not" and i told him not if he doesnt verify who he's picking up. he told me to shut is fucking door please. so i did and he left. i think it was actually carl because he started the ride without me in the car. i had to cancel the ride. this guy is creepy and gives off bad vibes. i really dont think he should be picking people up
MSG|444| i added a credit card as a payment option. your system says my credit card is invalid. that is incorrect. my card is valid and tried to do the update but the system didn't work. i also deleted and added my debit card. and that didn't work. what is wrong with your system?
MSG|445| i had to get out of the car within 2 minutes. one of worst drivers i have had in 33 years in new york
MSG|446| none
MSG|447| i need to speak with someone about this trip. i was unable to use my account. the trip lasted over 2hrs. an its saying i canceled now. earlier showed $0, i need someone to contact about this ride. 913-306-7612\nbrundy2010@hotmail.\n\nthanks \n\nsamuel brundy
MSG|448| when i canceled four minutes later it said he was still 10 minutes away which is where he started when i first called the uber. im sure he picked up someone at the airport no problem.
MSG|449| i was canceled on twice by another driver and each time i rebooked the fare went up, i had to wait an additional 30mins to get connected to an uber at the airport because of this
MSG|450| u all took the  money off my card the ride never came  i  call twice  and text him he never came please put my money back on my card. and  for future records  don't take money off without my permission thanks.
MSG|451| yes u all did take the money out my account i have the proof my bank account statement
MSG|452| never took the trip
MSG|453| i had him blocked on a previous account.
MSG|454| you need to pull that driver off the road he has no damn right to be so damn rude to me refusing my trip to the post office and refusing my trip to costco after i mail off a few things and tells me he's not going to wait for me you know what he has no right to talk to me that way at any time and when i told him to stop the car and let me out who's acting like a total ass
MSG|455| app keeps randomly cancelling rides
MSG|456| i requested this trip but the driver never stopped to pick me up he picked up someone else and kept going leaving me with no choice but to cancel the trip and i was still charged....
MSG|457| the driver picked a location that was 28 mins walking from my location
MSG|458| the driver couldnt find the location. i spoke to him on phone and still was unable to find me. i told him it was school and he said that he doesnt know any school. i had to cancel because there was no way for him to find me
MSG|459| i need my money return drive refused to drop so dont charge me, i need my cancellation fee back
MSG|460| i never took this uber, there isn't even a reciept available. return my money back to my card, i will not accept a credit for a mistake that is not mine. thank you.
MSG|461| my driver nataly arrived to pick me up then refused to take me to my office because it was in nyc.  she asked me to cancel the trip.  she should not be paid for this!
MSG|462| we ask for a uber xl cause we are 6 of us! it arriveed a standard car
MSG|463| hello, i was charged twice for the same uber ride. i was charged $20.02 twice, and id like a refund. im not expecting a refund for the trip i actually took, id just like to let you know the driver was unprofessional, the car had an oder, and she offered to let another passenger off on the highway after he critiqued her driving.   thank you!
MSG|464| my driver rudely hung up on me stating that location was wrong when it clearly stated where our location was at. he called and continuously hung up on me. very unprofessional and believe that he should rethink about his career, as we were charged for a fee that was not acceptable with the service we have just received.
MSG|465| my card doesnt work because i cancelled a trip
MSG|466| the waiting time was going up instead of down
MSG|467| i was charged for a ride that i cancelled. it was 5.86. i canceled the ride because it was 11 minutes away. may you please refund me or credit my account please. thank you
MSG|468| the driver kept on driving further away and wouldnt answer his phone. i called 6 times
MSG|469| the car smelled like vomit , my partner noticed my seatbelt had dried vomit on it . im sure the driver didnt realize the issue , but we had to switch ubers immediately. please remove my charge
MSG|470| i called for a ride and even texted the driver to make sure he had room for our luggage. he read but didnt respond and when he showed up he said he couldnt take us and for me to cancel, saying i wouldnt be charged but i did. i shouldnt be charged for this cancellation fee just because the driver had things in his trunk
MSG|471| the address was wrong to my destination. i stayed in the car for a little longer because the driver thought he could change it, but couldn't. therefore, i think i was charged for the trip.
MSG|472| driver picked up wrong person
MSG|473| driver did not end trip after dropping me off. pressed cancelation in error
MSG|474| no riders were avilable to pick me up at the time so u canceled the trip and still got charged 15 dollars
MSG|475| this is ridiculous, he kept moving further and further from 2 minutes away to 9 minutes to 13 minutes so i canceled im not paying this fee fix this or this will be the last time im using uber because you guys are scamming me
MSG|476| first off the driver did not know english then she went to the wrong place, i had to change the pick up location then my plans change she made my cancel the trip instead of going to the different place.
MSG|477| i have been using uber for several years now and i am disappointed in how long it took for us to get this ride. if uber charges the customer a cancelation fee to compensate the driver's time then it is only fare that customers are compensated for their time. uber canceled on me 4 times before i got this ride. this ride was a completely different street when i called the driver and i could not change on my app because it showed the address that i needed to be picked up in. then i contacted the driver and he was kind enough to come pick us up and i showed him that i put the same location as the correct pickup and it showed a different location on his. it is not the customer's fault and should be compensated for as i could have chosen pool but pool kept canceling on me and so i chose x and this happened. thank you for your time.
MSG|478| i see i was charged in my statement a cancellation fee for this trip i never took. i let you know right away that this driver had taken off without picking me up. please refund me.
MSG|479| $40 ride taking over 15 minutes when estimate was 8
MSG|480| the ride was accepted. the driver marked the ride started but i never was in the car. please remove this charge.
MSG|481| holding 12 pounds on my account \n\noutrageous thing to do !\ni think there should be some compensation for this . it is unheard of and frankly not lawful to do without consent / prior consent \ni wish for someone to make contact with me personally or otherwise i will escalate this \ndr richard wolman\n+447785225558
MSG|482| switch to my commuter benefits card ending in 7730
MSG|483| my phone has been acting funny and accidentally  called uber and she called me and i explained it was called accidentally and if she could just just cancel it please so it wouldnt charge me and she was rude and said well i didnt call it so please dont charge me
MSG|484| i need my 5 dollars refunded
MSG|485| i did not make the choice to meet driver at a further location, i choice my pickup spot, then the app switched on me. i am not mobile to walk so for sure i didnt choose that option
MSG|486| i was charged in my uber cash and never took ride. i didnt want to take express pool
MSG|487| my driver started the trip without me far from where i was
MSG|488| driver didnt cancel on me and instead told the app he picked me up and continued on the route. so i was left with no choice but to cancel
MSG|489| someone took this trip and i was charge $9.24
MSG|490| going to far
MSG|491| he told him that he couldn't make a stop, then cancelled the ride when they did stop. i was charged for the ride even though i feel like that was not just due to him cancelling and not wanting to give him his one stop. i had to reschedule another ride that will cost me around 20 dollars. i would like the money i was charged to either go towards the second ride or be refunded please
MSG|492| he cancelled after i sat in the car as he didnt want to go to airport. asked me get out of the car . i am going to miss my flight now !!!!
MSG|493| driver didnt even wait 5 min i i saw him he didnt see me and take off i called 3-4 times and hes didnt even respond or canceled my trip hes was waiting for me to cancel so hes can get pay i need my refund back
MSG|494| some one used my phone to request this trip
MSG|495| my driver literally picked up the wrong person right in front of me and started the trip. now i had to cancel and request a new driver because he did not check
MSG|496| this driver had defecated in his car and became belligerent. he shouldnt be driving
MSG|497| car was filled with the residue of cigarette smoke, damaging  my health. had to exit one block after entering car. we exited for safety reasons. this was not a typical cancellation. please reimburse any charges and compensate for damages incurred during the short time we were in the unsafe car.
MSG|498| i requested a ride for a friend thru my uber account. but i was informed in the middle of the trip that an unknown occupant took the ride without the drivers knowledge. i informed the driver that the person in the vehicles was not the correct person and i then canceled the trip.
MSG|499| pick locations is far
MSG|500| cancel the driver told me to cancel and then hung up on me
MSG|501| the driver had marked that she had already picked me up, showing that i was on the trip, but that wasnt the case. i never got picked up.
MSG|502| i didnt take this trip and it said i was in the car i need my complete refund now
MSG|503| my driver refused to pick me up
MSG|504| i have no issue with my cancellation fee and was not charged one. instead, i wanted to complain about the state of uber black at lax. black car drivers at lax constantly refuse to pick me up because i live too close to the airport. they do not want to cancel, so instead just refuse to move anywhere until i get frustrated and cancel. they call me as soon as i request a ride and ask where im going. this is a constant problem with uber black at lax and has been for months. please fix it!!
MSG|505| i had a 30% off 10 rides i didn't use 10 rides this week
MSG|506| the driver has a 4.78 rating. thats a low rating for me to get in the car.
MSG|507| can i get my refund
