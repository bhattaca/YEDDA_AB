MSG|1165| the driver was on able to find me, i dont feel like i should be charged a cancellation fee because he was unable to find me and he missed the address at which you are supposed to meet me at. he seemed in competent and it seems like the right thing to do was for me to cancel the ride.
MSG|1166| he was rude and called me names! he needs to be fired!  rudest person ever i ever dealt with!
MSG|1167| my driver was moving away from pick up location and wait minutes increased
MSG|1168| i cancelled this trip, but my credit card got charge $8.59. please process for refunding.
MSG|1169| driver moved away from pick up point
MSG|1170| this is absolutely unacceptable. i sat outside waiting for my driver for 15 minutes. he argued with me and was rude to me via messages i asked him to cancel repeatedly and he ignored me and then when he finally got to my destination he drove right past me and canceled. someone like this should not be driving.
MSG|1171| i was not picked up like it said i was. i called the driver a.d he said he picked someone up else up thinking it was me. but i was never picked up. this is the second time this has happened to me on my way to work.
MSG|1172| he did not have enough space
MSG|1173| wasnt no where to be found and did not speak proper english!!! started ride without me in the car i want my money back
MSG|1174| he didnt wait for me and he left
MSG|1175| this uber driver didnt open his door to meet me s d take my small carry-on bad , drove away very quickly as i was approaching his car!  because he was incorrectly parked with a heavy flow of traffic he was doors hi g with me behind the driver getting ready to open the door when this driver abruptly pulled away into traffic.do
MSG|1176| didnt get picked up uber driver said it picked me up
MSG|1177| i was 4 blocks from my home, and the driver let me out instead of going 15 min the other direction and then back. pleas charge only the $6 as promised.
MSG|1178| driver never picked me up but was still driving on my account i would also like to report that cause he thats unprofessional and actually stealing from me taking my money but never give me the ride
MSG|1179| i had 2 ubers cancel on me this morning and couldnt find my location, one cancelled as i was running out into traffic as he drove past me. i showed him i had his license plate and he cancelled as i was standing in traffic. uber service is actually horrendous
MSG|1180| the uber driver did not show at pick up location.
MSG|1181| i got the same driver who didnt come for over 10 minutes the first time i booked and hence the repeated cancellation. he was suppose to arrive in 8 mins but on the gps it showed he was going around in the wrong direction and the wait just got too long from the initial given time
MSG|1182| my driver pressed the pickup option before i even got in the car
MSG|1183| the drive was speeding 20 mph over the limit posted and almost rear ended a car
MSG|1184| i ordered an x instead of pool right after
MSG|1185| he did not come and pick me up. but he charged me the fee. so i canceled the trip. i dont understand about the cancellation fee. please help me to solve this problem
MSG|1186| hello,\ni never took this trip. i ordered a uber but he didn't show up and i saw on the app that the trip had started so i cancelled it. whenever i'm trying to report the issue on the app support section it says that the trip was never charged to me however the amount has been posted on my credit card.\nthanks,\naurelien fiammante
MSG|1187| it was the wrong pick up stop
MSG|1188| he was 8 minutes away for over 4 minutes. the app didnt update.
MSG|1189| the driver said he picked us up before she even showed up and then never showed up. he wouldnt answer the phone when i called either.
MSG|1190| first of i told him to stay where he was and kept moving, second he started the trip without me there and started moving toward the destination every time further away from where i was and i had my live gps map from where i was and third he didnt respond any of the multiple calls i did or texts i sent even though it said he already read. so yes i dont think he deserves any of the cancelation fee, if someone time was wasted was mine, thanks to him i am late, so i ask of you to give me my money back. thank you
MSG|1191| hi, not sure where the correct place to request help is, but was hoping you could help me sort out my most recent ride. due to a family emergency, i left the car shortly after getting on. my ride shows as cancelled, but my card was still charged ~$48. could you kindly adjust this to something more equitable? appreciate your help!
MSG|1192| driver ran out of gas leaving me and another passenger stranded
MSG|1193| he did not pull into my coldisac. drove off didnt csll
MSG|1194| i couldnt see but the driver kept looking back. this needs to be reported to the airport and birmingham police which i plan to do tomorrow morning. thank god for this very sweet driver named clarence who picked me up after and got me to my house safely.
MSG|1195| they driver never picked me up and he accepted the ride as if i was in it. this is unacceptable and your drivers should not do that and now im late to work because of your driver.
MSG|1196| the money has still not been refunded.
MSG|1197| i took a ride from slc airport to a hotel today.  the fare was $19.00 plus my $4 tip.   the driver must not have turned my ride off b/c my fare jumped to $53.00.  i could see (on app) that he was still driving around, on my clock.  please adjust my fare back to what it shouldve been.
MSG|1198| he refused my trip, why do i have to pay cancellation fee? i got in his car, and he said hes not going there! this charge is not fair!
MSG|1199| my driver sent me a message to cancel the ride because she is stuck on the highway and there is an accident and she could not get to me.
MSG|1200| my ride started with me so i canceled it
MSG|1201| 
MSG|1202| i had requested an uberpool ride, but i opted out of having to walk to the pick up spot. so i was charged an additional $3 and change. this is fine. the driver seemed lost on the map. so i called him to see where he was at and to give directions on how to get ot my location. even after giving him clear directions and explaining multiple times how to get to my location, and after over 10 minutes, he still couldn't find me. i ended up having to walk to meet him. i didn't have enough money on my card to cancel and request a new ride, which is what i would've done in this case. after finally finding where he was parked, we were on our way to drop me off at my destination. after he dropped me off and even after i had already settled down, i noticed i hadn't gotten the notification that my ride had ended. i opened the uber app, and my ride was showing as still in progress. (i have screenshots of the time i was dropped off and the map was showing an active ride.) so, i continued to wait. eventually i cancelled it and kept trying to find how to get help with this so i could pay for the trip for the correct amount of time and mileage and nothing more or less. finally, i went to my ride history and clicked on the ride and it said i was refunded for the ride and it was under ubercredits. i scrolled to find uber credits under the payment tab and there was no option. (i have screenshots of these as well if you would like them.) i wake up this morning to a notification from my bank that i was charged an additional $1.64. what is this charge for? he did not end my ride when he dropped me off, and i'm being charged for his negligence. i'm really furious and i am considering taking my services to lyft. i ride uber at least 6 times a week, spending over $300 a month. i would like to be refunded for my ride and for this inconvenience. and i would like an explanation as to why uber would charge me an additional amount when the ride was only supposed to be $13 and some change.
MSG|1203| the driver was supposed to enter my condominium. i gave him specific instructions and also the code of my gate. he said he would go inside my house and when i checked my route he never came inside and he simply left and said the trip had started and charged me. i canceled while on trip and now i am being charged without me even getting on. i had to get another uber after that. this is very unprofessional and i would like my money back. thank you
MSG|1204| i was charged a cancellation fee or something because i ordered a trip  the car came thru then the driver canceled so i tried to get the money back but pushed the wrong button and they charged me a cancellation fee and it was the driver who canceled
MSG|1205| []
MSG|1206| car didn't pick me up, messaged me and said to cancel. was made extremely late to an event.
MSG|1207| he wasted an upwards of 10 minutes of my time. i got matched with him but he kept driving in the opposite direction. he didn't want to pick me up but didn't want to cancel because they probably get cancelation fees charged too.. i was waiting and waiting while he kept driving in the opposite direction. i have screenshots. 2 drivers today wasted about half an hr of my time. this is unacceptable
MSG|1208| i was incorrectly charged a cancellation fee for a uber driver, who drove off without picking me up and started my ride without me in the car. i called the uber driver 3 times on my phone and the uber phone, i even texted him twice, he did not respond. i would like my money back please because i was incorrectly charged for a ride i never received
MSG|1209| i need refund
MSG|1210| i accidentally requested an uber and $10 was still taken out of my account. i canceled it immediately once i realized money was taken out of my bank account
MSG|1211| i ordered an uber for two stops. the driver called to verify my address since the driver claimed the app cleared my address.  i waited the allocated but she did not arrive. i should not be charged
MSG|1212| he kept taking my ride, even though i told him not too and that he was too far and i was running late, and when i called and told him to stop taking my ride he laughed and hung  up
MSG|1213| yes
MSG|1214| i would like to officially file a complaint against this driver who wasted my time and refused to take my service dog that needs to be with me for medical reasons
MSG|1215| the driver stayed in the same spot for about 10 min and i tried contacting him no response
MSG|1216| my driver dropped off his fare, i got notified i got picked up but i didnt and he proceeded to get his next ride. i never got into the car! he skipped me
MSG|1217| the driver said he was going to come across the street to get me then he disappeared and started my ride!!
MSG|1218| i never got picked up from my pick up location so i had to cancel and reorder a ride
MSG|1219| very bad experience because they always cancel, i will discountinue using uber!
MSG|1220| driver asked me to cancel
MSG|1221| false
MSG|1222| hello! i accidentally put the wrong address for my destination. i got off with the first passenger at 150 huntington ave. i believe i should be charged the original pool amount or less. thanks!
MSG|1223| i immediately had to jump out of the ride as my destination was not correct and i was in able to change as it was a pool.
MSG|1224| refund
MSG|1225| i didnt approve for this ride and didnt take ride
MSG|1226| the driver continued to drive south and was 20 blocks south of me at the time i finally cancelled. he was continually going in the opposite direction from me and i received no notice from him that he was intending to turn around to come towards me. after several calls and no nearby vehicles i had to just take the subway home. i took screenshots of him continually driving further away if that is needed to remove this cancellation fee.
MSG|1227| the driver wasn't outside in the location
MSG|1228| the pickup location was incorrect n was unable to adjust because it just barely was out of the circle.
MSG|1229| he started the ride without me in the car wth?
MSG|1230| my ride never picked me up. it showed them driving along the route but they never actually picked me up. id like to be reimbursed for that ride, as i had to cancel and order a new uber for a lot more money.
MSG|1231| complete bullshit ride. about two blocks from home, and routes to pickup another passenger in opposite direction. got out and walked home in 5min, vs. a fucking 20min eta on the uber pool. only thing thats holding me from undownloading this shit is the $288 uber cash on this.
MSG|1232| it wasnt my fault this lady took all day and she didnt even know where i was so unfair i want my money back im not paying a cancellation fee she didnt even answer the phone
MSG|1233| this was requested after my first trip was cancelled. it was for someone else, and my assumption was that since my trip was cancelled that the next trip would use the same pickup and destination locations.
MSG|1234| i cancelled this before it was five minutes but can u ease verify that i wasnt charged
MSG|1235| driver didnt move towards my location nor did he respond to my calls or text messages
MSG|1236| driver never picked me up
MSG|1237| it took me four tries to get an uber driver saturday night, i felt it was very dangerous. this uber driver never showed up nor answered my call or text
MSG|1238| the app is saying my driver "travellers" towards me for 7 minutes 10 seconds, the reality, however, is that he was 12 minutes away from me and was 10 minutes away when i cancelled after accepting the fare with no previous fare to drop off. he wasn't driving towards my location, so i went on lyft and ordered a ride that actually decided to come and pick me up when i asked. i want every dollar of this bullshit cancelation fee returned.
MSG|1239| i just canceled it 20 seconds after and i got charged for the normal price and thats not fair.
MSG|1240| the driver said hes car has flat tire, so he told us to cancel and get another uber. the driver said he will also contact the uber as well. so i shouldnt be charged for cancellation fee. thank you.
MSG|1241| again!! someone took my uber!! do they not ask the name!!!
MSG|1242| why was i billed for this? the driver was 14 minutes away when i was quoted half of that
MSG|1243| driver canceled my trip because i was standing opposite side of road and i wasnt able to walk due to my leg injury
MSG|1244| the driver started the trip and never picked me up
MSG|1245| i was charged on my credit card with the amount 13.91$ , my driver never moved i called him 7 times, texted him multiple times he read my messages but never replied and kept me waiting for 18 mnts
MSG|1246| my driver was driving away from the location i requested and his eta kept getting longer
MSG|1247| driver accepted ride when they were in brooklyn .
MSG|1248| i never took this ride or got in this car. as i was walking to get in the car he started the trip and drove away. i would like a full refund.
MSG|1249| my driver never showed up
MSG|1250| my driver parked 1 block away from location, sat there, i ran to her in the pouring rain and she drove off. i was soaked and also nowhere near cover standing in front of clemente hs.
MSG|1251| i was waiting for the car over 20 minutes i try to rich him send the message was no answer
MSG|1252| im currently in this uber ride, somehow we got disconnected. but im still in the car and he is going to drop me off at my location
MSG|1253| i didnt type that address in and was unnecessarily charged a fee.
MSG|1254| could not enter destination
MSG|1255| the driver said he picked me up but never did. i called he didnt answer. not my fault for canceling
MSG|1256| she never picked me up and she put as she picked me up i am still at hyde apartments when i talked to her she just said i dont know  what kind of clowns are your drivers ?
MSG|1257| i was dropped off in middle of my journey . off an highway and was left stranded.
MSG|1258| i had $18 cash in uber cash ($5 two times) & two ride canceled charge refunds date-5/11/19-1.57 pm -$5 & date-5/11/19-11.03 am -$3 ,so total-$18 . problem is that when i tried to use this amount & need to add extra fund in it its disappeared now i can use that fund . i want uber should add that in my cash payment.i am using uber from last 4 years .again i got saving in my cash account recently & added $25 in it & total was $33.29 .please return my $18 to my cash payment account
MSG|1259| my uber driver never showed up ! said. he was a minute away - never showed - never picked up phone or notes - never replied - this was a scheduled ride for the airport !!!!!!! so unprofessional
MSG|1260| took money out my account and havent return the money
MSG|1261| both my and the drivers uber application was not working. so one minute into ride i decided to cancel.
MSG|1262| he was far from me though it was fun when i told him he wasnt near me could he drop my ride he said no
MSG|1263| i cancelled immediately because driver time changed from initial time and was taking too long
MSG|1264| my drivers car did not feel safe enough for me to feel comfortable getting into
MSG|1265| he never picked me up . im so mad.
MSG|1266| i got picked up by my uber and my pick up location was incorrect on the app so was told to cancel my ride because it wouldnt show that  he picked me up so i canceled and it charged me a $5 fee and i just wanted my $5 fee refunded because my location was correct and he still picked me up but i had to cancel because of the app
MSG|1267| please credit the $8 back to my account as the driver was supposed to cancel the ride.  thank you.
MSG|1268| ride destination was incorrect.
MSG|1269| i kept asking him where he was because he kept going to complete opposite way. i continued to explain to him that i was late to work already and he didnt reply to any of the six messages i have sent him. he continuously left me on read. he went from one minute to 7 minutes away and on top of that i had to pay a cancellation fee for wasting his time more like he wasted time. completely unbelievable and unprofessional, especially because i am now over 20 minutes late to work.
MSG|1270| after taking me in tshering the driver suddenly blurted out  for me to get out of his suburban. i asked why? and he shouted just get out you cancelled a trip!!! i said i did not cancel a trip n begged him to take me to my destination especially because i have 5 bags to carry with me. he shoved me n humiliated me. i always use uber whenever i am here in nyc and was treated this bad for the first time. no wonder some friends of mine keep saying to try lyft. i feel soooo bad having been treated by your driver tshering.
MSG|1271| i shouldn't be charged for the trip and i never took it
MSG|1272| he didn't pick me up. stated he was on the way to my destination!!!! uber charged me. i'm still waiting had to cancel cause he went without me or picked up someone else.
MSG|1273| i was charged twice for this trip
MSG|1274| it would have taken my driver an exhorberant amount of time to arrive.    i cancelled immediately and would very much like a refund.   time of arrival was not accurate.
MSG|1275| i let the driver know i had a service dog he said he don't accept dogs in his car then i advised him that he better because it's against the law and he can lose his job then he called me and i told him to pick me up he hung up on me and canceled my ride
MSG|1276| i was only supposed to be charged a 5.00 cancellation fee but uber still charged my card ending in 9563 for 13.66
MSG|1277| the driver did not stop the trip after i arrived at my destination.
MSG|1278| i waited 20 minutes for this driver to arrive.  i finally cancelled and pinged another driver, raquel. she lacked general driving proficiency and inability to follow the navigation - taking me the long way to my destination and missing two exits along the way. as a result, i missed my 145 training causing me to purchase a replacement ticket for $50. i would appreciate some sort of compensation for this lack luster experience.
MSG|1279| i was refunded for the first trip i canceled but this trip i was still charged
MSG|1280| i cancelled within one minute
MSG|1281| hi, i had two back-to-back driver issues this morning and would like both cancellation fees refunded please. the first driver stopped somewhere other than my address and wouldnt pick up my calls to locate her. my second driver took a bridge headed in the wrong direction and went from 1min away to over 10min away. he also didnt answer my call to explain what was going on.
MSG|1282| the guy cancelled my trip because he didnt know where the visitors entrance was to adept of commerce. and he barely spoke english
MSG|1283|07 pm , and you show me my drive supposed to be in my place in 3 minutes, after that show me my uber was 15 minutes away , so i cancelled. after that i ordered other one who tooks around 7 minutes to arrive and also gave to me the last drop off spot. such a bad customer service , wont never use again!  .. basically took me half an hour to wait for and uber...
MSG|1284| i have not been refunded for the full fare yet ive only been refunded the cancellation fee.. my bank never received the refund amount for the trip amount
MSG|1285| driver messaged me stating he would be unable to pick me up..
MSG|1286| my driver skipped my pick up spot, drove right by me, and then after i called him he said hed come back, he never came back for me
MSG|1287|45 am. when i entered the pick up location and our destination, the driver responded immediately and said he was here. i called him and said something is wrong. we need a driver tomorrow morning not tonight.  this was my first and most likely last time using uber. he did not drive here as he responded immediately. the cancellation fee uber charged is very, very unfair and i am requesting it be reversed.
MSG|1288| my driver did not confirm my name and had another passenger in the car with him when i called an uber x.... not sure what that was about but i want my cancellation fee back. thanks
MSG|1289| the driver refused to cancel the ride and refused to take me to the airport . he stated that the uber application was broken and does not show him that it was a long trip.
MSG|1290| i was charged for this trip but dropped off no were near my destination. we were visiting our daughter. we don't know are way around. the address i entered was not what was given to the driver, the app said we had to walk, so thought we would have to walk a block or so. turns out we were taken farther away from our destination. the driver told us to request a refund and drop us off.
MSG|1291| trip was never ordered - i was not in the location of pick up and did not order a trip for anyone \nplease advise how to get credit to bank card
MSG|1292| why am i being charged for a ride  i wasnt in
MSG|1293| the driver never shows up. and when i called him, he did not spoke to me! the driver refuse to enter the right parking lot of sea world. waste of my time. it is not my fault that he did not find me!
MSG|1294| my daughter came home unexpectedly so i have to cancel the trip sorry guys i normally don't do that
MSG|1295| driver did not pick me up and started heading towards destination. the application said how is your trip going  while i was still at my house.
MSG|1296| i wasnt refunded the $6.84 after i cancelled my uber but i was still charged a $.96 fee which i assume is the cancellation fee. i would like to be refunded at least partially because i did not even make it half way to my destination and i got out as we were stopping to pick up another passenger
MSG|1297| why was my account debited twice for the entire fee which i canceled?
MSG|1298| the driver said she was unable to come to where we are so we rushed upstairs only to be told by officials that we should be downstairs and the driver wouldnt cancel, forcing me to absorb the fee. frustrating and set us back quite a bit.
MSG|1299| as soon as i booked uber, the driver initiated the trip without having picked me up
MSG|1300| my driver was rude and completely impatient. i was suggesting a route more desirable to get into manhattan faster. he actually became belligerent and said i said i should get out of care a cursed  using the fbomb repeatingly. respect is a two way street and i was tying to help him get me to my destination. it was raining and just simply uncool!
MSG|1301| car did not arrive at the pickup place at lax, driver did not call. colleague ordered another car, which we used.
MSG|1302| my driver was not outside waiting for me! i'm a single person and was waiting alone
MSG|1303| someone i dont know hacked in to my uber account and tried to use it
MSG|1304| totally rude. then told me he would wait for my friend. tried to drive off. i literally jumped out of the car. he also approved a $70 uber verse the cheapest one.
MSG|1305| they said they are having car trouble and the fee was charged to my account
MSG|1306| i am a platinum member and do not get charged cancellation fees. the driver was extremely rude and said i would  be reimbursed for cancellation.
MSG|1307| ive been riding with this person and i dont feel safe when im with him dont match me with that person.
MSG|1308| this ia ridulous the time kept getting worse and worse!!!!!!!! uber was freezing and i had to cancel because the eta was getting longer and longer
MSG|1309| my driver was arriving too fast, normally when i order an uber i have roughly 7-8 minutes before they come which is more than enough time for me to grab my jacket and head downstairs. unfortunately this ubers arrival time was too much of a short notice for me and i would not be able to get downstairs by the time he came. instead of wasting our time, i decided to cancel.
MSG|1310| the driver never moved towards our location. call the driver and he ignored. this is absurd!
MSG|1311| please refund my cancellation fee
MSG|1312| the driver started the ride without me
MSG|1313| driver started ride and just drove away before we got in the car, then wouldnt reply to messages
MSG|1314|22 am may 31, 2019.
MSG|1315| after last night i will no longer use uber this is some bullshit honestly. its always something with uber drivers or uber support i hate it. last night my driver seen me walking to his car and pulled off fast i contacted him via text and phone he declined my call and didnt reply to my text. he waited 10seconds if that before even pulling off which he didnt even have to wait because i was already there. instead of him canceling my trip he proceeded to start the trip as if i was in the car and never canceled it knowing i wasnt in the car i had to cancel it
MSG|1316| hello, my name is leonela. im a little concerned about this last uber, i was checking how much was a trip from boston to new hampshire and i accidentally pressed confirm trip which i immediately canceled it, it didnt even show any driver, but they still charged th cost of the trip. so my question is how long do i have to wait to get my money back? because i didnt get any uber. thank you.
MSG|1317| i was charged for this ride and it didnt even come ! the lady called and said she would have to cancel my ride and i would not be charged but she never cancelled and i canceled it and i was charged.
MSG|1318| i got charged
MSG|1319| my driver was a different locqrion he never pick me up
MSG|1320| platinum member and cancellation fee waiver up to a certain amount of time is allowable and i haven't exceeded the allowable amount in accordance with my membership policy
MSG|1321| my driver picked up the wrong person, i received a ride from another driver in a buick
MSG|1322| the cancellation credit was not added to my account
MSG|1323| the driver was not moving towards my location. i did not have the time to wait.
MSG|1324| hi i was incorrectly charged my driver canceled the ride so im not sure why im getting charged the cancellation fee.
MSG|1325| completely unprofessional - he tried to force us to pay $20 cash in addition to the agreed fare through uber and then drove away when we refused.
MSG|1326| this driver refused my ride and left me stranded. he called me and asked me where i was going and demanded i cancel. when i did not he messaged me that he had an accident after he called me to create a false paper trail. he should be removed from service immediately! i trusted uber to get me home safely in a neighborhood where i cannot walk home and he left me stranded. i have never had a driver refuse a trip in my years of using uber around the world.
MSG|1327| i needed to change my address, i accidentally put in an old one and the app wouldn't let me even with the driver's help.we had to left the pickup space
MSG|1328| my trip was cancelled 12 minutes before schefuled arrival. also have uber app saying i was not charged. payment was charged. would like refund, please.
MSG|1329| this ride wait time was way too long and that's why i cancelled it i cancelled it immediately after ordering it and don't see why i'm being charged please credit my uber account
MSG|1330| my driver never picked me up but accepted my trip and i was charged
MSG|1331| hi. i had an emergency last night and had to go to the hospital. since i have a baby at home my mother was supposed to come and watch the baby while i go to er. i called uber and hit cancel by accident. within minutes my husband called the same route uber from his account 917-440-7999 and we fully paid for that car ride. i am asking for a courtesy to remove the cancellation fee from this ride. i have er documents for proof if needed and can send them in. thank you.
MSG|1332| my trip was a pool and it said 15$ and he picked up someone else and i never got my cab why is it 54$ because i cancel
MSG|1333| i better hope i dont get charged for this because we waited 20 minutes and the driver called 2 times and could barely speak english and he was lost and just stopped to care to pick me up
MSG|1334| driver got lost and took too lof
MSG|1335| the request was  1 minute after the request i had a emergency with my child i couldnt wait
